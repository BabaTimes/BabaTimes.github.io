Sai Satcharita Introduction
* * *
Shri Sai Baba lived in Shirdi, which is in Maharashtra, India, between 1858 and 1918. Devotees believe that Baba is an incarnation of Lord Dattatreya, and lived a life of purity and love. Baba delivered spiritual teachings to his visitors, recommending the reading of sacred Hindu texts and the Qur'an. He did not believe in any one religion, but in one God and the goodness of people. Baba advised his followers to lead moral lives, help others, love every living being without discrimination. Most importantly, Baba taught people to develop two important features of character: faith (_shraddha_) and patience (_saburi_).
Shri Sai Satcharitra is collection of stories and miracles (_leelas_) that have been witnessed by devotees of Shri Shirdi Sai Baba during his lifetime. They were written down by one of Babaâ€™s devotees, Hemadpant, so that future generations would understand His love and teachings.
