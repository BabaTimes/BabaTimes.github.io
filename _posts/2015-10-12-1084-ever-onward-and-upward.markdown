**Ever Onward and Upward**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Ponder These Truths**](http://www.dlshq.org/download/ponder.htm#_VPID_149) **by Sri Swami Chidananda**

**Om Sri Sadguru Paramatmane Namah**

Radiant Divinities! Beloved and blessed children of Light! Yogis engaged in Yoga practices according to your own temperament and inclination! Yoga practice leads to the ultimate truth of Yoga, which is the cessation of all pain and suffering, the attainment of supreme bliss, the transcendence of limitations of time and space, birth and death, and becoming established forever in a state of fearlessness and freedom. The fruit of Yoga is _kaivalya moksha samrajya_ (the kingdom of final liberation). It is that grand and glorious state of liberation, liberated consciousness, untrammelled by limitations of finite adjuncts and additives. When consciousness regains its pristine state of perennial purity, when it is unqualified, unlimited, transcending barriers that bind you down, you realise yourself as the pure Consciousness in its absolute state, characterised by peace and bliss.

“Yoga becomes the destroyer of sorrow for one who is wise, one who is moderate in all things, one who is self-controlled, one who is ever awake and vigilant and one who diligently pursues the path of _yoga sadhana_, does not give up.” Thus the great Teacher, master of Yoga, _yogesvara_ Lord Krishna tries to bring to us the truth of Yoga.

To attain this great truth of the sorrowless state of peace and joy, you have turned away from the delusions of the fleeting scene of passing events and perishable objects and have set your face to seek the Imperishable, the Immortal. Be determined that you will persist in this quest until the Goal is attained. Let not anything in this universe bring even a shadow of a doubt, even the slightest ripple of hesitation in this determined pursuit after the one and only worthwhile goal that there is in human existence. All other things are fraught with pain, all other things are fraught with innumerable defects, all other things are ever enveloped by sure decay and ultimate dissolution.

All things, including your own temporary earth personality are subject to disease and decay. Nothing can alter this fact though deluded people try to perpetuate physical life. Physical life is not to be hated, but it is not to be pampered or clung to. Physical life is not a deity to be worshipped; it is not a goal in itself. Physical life, if well lived, properly understood and wisely controlled, and directed with discrimination and understanding, may serve as a means to fulfil the prime purpose for which you have come here, which is supra-physical, supramundane, spiritual. Be, therefore, determined that nothing lesser will ever divert you from this great quest of the Eternal, the Imperishable, the Real.

Let each moment and each day of your life be as a series of steps climbing higher and higher until you attain the supreme Goal which is here. It is not somewhere high up, it is here. Let that be your life. Each day let it be a step higher. Make up your mind that this shall be your life, having but one determined direction, having but one fixed goal, one pattern, an ever upward ascent. To this end, do all that you can.

Innumerable minor distractions not withstanding, the greatest deception is the swift passage of time that goes unperceived. Take up this challenge. Say: “I will not be deceived, I shall not allow time to dupe me. I shall be aware of each passing moment and enrich myself. I shall enrich myself in each passing moment, by each passing moment; and thus, with each passing moment I shall find myself richer, higher, nearer to the great consummation.” With this spirit live your life. Then there shall not be one dull moment, I promise you. When you are looking forward to something, when each moment of life means something to you, there can be no monotony, there cannot be one single dull moment. There will be a keenness to the spirit as you live life for a great purpose. That should be the inner climate of the true Yogi—_utsahasampanna_ (endowed with inspiration, zeal).

May God bless you all! May the Supreme, which is the greatest Beauty of beauties, the supreme Value, the one absolute Reality, ever shine before you, not only as your ultimate goal but even as your immediate goal! Live in that Presence.

May the spiritual presence of beloved and worshipful Gurudev, that shines here as the silent light, ever inspire you to keep on towards this great attainment! May your indwelling Reality ever draw you towards that supreme achievement! May your own love for it, your intense aspiration for it, be the power that takes you onward and upward day after day!

Om Tat Sat Brahmaparnamastu
