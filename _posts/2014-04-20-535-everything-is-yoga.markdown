**Everything Is Yoga**
**Divine Life Society Publication: -** [**Everything Is Yoga**](http://www.dlshq.org/messages/everythingyoga.htm) **by Swami Chidananda**
Worshipful homage to that supreme, eternal, universal Being, Lord Krishna, who revealed Himself in and through the Gita wisdom teachings that He imparted for all mankind, for all times, through His beloved devotee and disciple, Arjuna. He not only revealed His divine nature through His Bhagavad Gita teachings, He also revealed how man can realize Him fully, can experience Him, and, ultimately, how man can merge himself in Him to become one with Him. All this He taught within the compass of 700 brief verses contained in 18 chapters.
**Main teaching**
Attain through Yoga the supreme human experience of our essential non-differentiation from Him; the experience that liberates us forever from all sorrow, all confusion and delusion; the experience that liberates us once and for all from a return to successive birth, death and rebirth in this mortal world.
The four classical _yogas_ are—channelizing our action potential through _karma_ _yoga_ for God-realization, channelizing our sentiment and emotion potential for realizing God through _bhakti_ _yoga_, channelizing our mind’s power of concentration for attaining God-realization through _raja_ _yoga_, through meditation, and channelizing our intellectual potential of analysis, logic, discrimination and reasoning to attain illumination through _jnana_ _yoga_. Here in the Gita we have 18 _yogas_. Everything is _yoga_. He covers the whole of human life in His teaching.
**Everything is _yoga_**
The central teaching is that, in fact, all life is _yoga_. Life is to be lived as the great _sadhana_, the great _yoga_. All actions constitute _yoga_. Everything that you think is _yoga_. Everything that you speak is _yoga_. Everything that you do is _yoga_. Life is the supreme _yoga_, every part of it.
Each and every one of our actions from morning till evening should have a Godward thrust; they are to be engaged in for attaining illumination. Everything in our life is and ought to be enlightenment oriented. Breathing, sitting, standing, running, resting, working, lying, waking, dreaming, sleeping, all constitute that one single process—_yoga_. So there are not merely 18 _yogas_. There are innumerable _yogas_ every moment. This is the great truth about you, about each and every one of us.
May the grace of the Supreme and the benedictions of revered and beloved Holy Master Gurudev Swami Sivanandaji enable us to fully recognize this truth, fully assimilate this truth, fully live in the light of this truth, and thus become the Truth. May God bless us all!
