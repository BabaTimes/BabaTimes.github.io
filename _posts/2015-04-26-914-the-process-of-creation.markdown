**The Process of Creation according to Sankhya and the Vedanta**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Everything About Spiritual Life**](http://swami-krishnananda.org/everything/everything_07.html) **by Swami Krishnananda**
The process of the coming down of the categories of creation, both from the point of view of the Sankhya and the Vedanta. What does the Sankhya say? There is an infinite universal _purusha_ consciousness all pervading. There is a _prakriti_ or the potentiality for the manifestation of all the things of the world. In light of the Sankhya philosophy, this _prakriti_ or the potentiality of creation is made up of three strands, as they call it, the properties _sattva_, _rajas_ and _tamas_. The equilibrated condition of the _prakriti_ is called _sattva_; the _rajasic_ or distracting, dividing activity of _prakriti_ is called _rajas_; and the inert, non-active, inactive condition is called _tamas_. When the _purusha_ consciousness reflects itself in this equilibrated aspect of _prakriti_, it becomes a cosmic conscious potential creative force called Mahat. Sometimes this Mahat is identified with Brahma, the creator, about which we hear much in the Puranas and the epics. This Mahat is a cosmic generality of awareness of everything. In the case of _purusha_, we cannot say that it is aware of everything, because there is no question of space, time, or anything. So, _purusha_ is just what it is. So, we cannot say _purusha_ is cosmically conscious, etc. That designation is applicable only to Mahat, where the potentialities of space-time emerge, and there is a cosmic consciousness, potential omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence. This cosmicality of Mahat becomes conscious of itself: “I am the all-pervading being.” This particular stage is called Ahamkara when the cosmic consciousness makes a cosmic affirmation of this otherwise-universal omnipresence and asserts itself as _aham asmi_ – I am, I am what I am, I am that I am. Don’t mistake this Ahamkara with egoism of a human being. Egoism, as we understand in common parlance, is pride, assertiveness of a bodily individuality. This has to be distinguished completely from the word Ahamkara. Actually, the Sankhya could have used another word, instead of confusing this Ahamkara with that _ahamkara_. Anyway, this has been called Ahamkara – cosmic awareness of one’s being oneself only, and there is nothing external to oneself.
Here, we have a similarity with the Vedanta doctrine of the Absolute Parabrahman. There also the word _prakriti_ is used. Sometimes, the word _maya_ is used. They are practically the same thing, and the Vedanta also accepts the term _prakriti_, as we have it in the Mahabharata. The Manusmriti and the Bhagavadgita also accept the presence of a _prakriti_, though from another standpoint altogether. This _prakriti_ has three strands, as I mentioned, three properties – _sattva, rajas_ and _tamas_. When this cosmic enlightened condition, pure reflective capacity, receives the cosmic consciousness of the Mahat in its assertive, self-conscious form, it becomes Ahamkara. Thus, we have _purusha_, _prakriti_, Mahat, Ahamkara, the categories of descent.
Here, a threefold splitting of operation takes place. The _adhyatma, adhibhuta,_ and _adhidaiva_ stages are supposed to be the threefold ramifications of this central universal Self-consciousness of ‘I am’. What are these three categorisations or split forms? On the one hand, there is the individual observer of the world; on the other hand, there is the observed physical world; in the middle, there is the connecting link – the _purusha_, Supreme Brahman consciousness itself linking the subject with the object. The objects cannot be known to exist unless the senses are connected to the object through a third medium, which is invisible to the sense organs. That medium is called _adhidaiva_, a superintending divinity. So, three ramifications take place after the Ahamkara manifests itself – the individual perceiver, the world of objectivity or perception, and the invisible connecting link which is the devata, _adhidaiva_.
The _rajasic_ aspect of _prakriti_ has created this threefold ramification, and the _sattva_ aspect gives the tinge of consciousness in the individual that cognises. We are aware that we are cognising or perceiving things; this awareness consciousness is a reflection of _purusha_, Brahma consciousness itself. The differentiation that we feel between ourselves and the object is due to the _rajas_. The _tamas_ aspect has its own say; space, time, and causation is the first vibratory process in the _tamas_ aspect of _prakriti_. That condenses itself into a grosser form of vibrations called potentials for the manifestations of the five elements earth, water, fire, air, ether. These potentials are called _tanmatras_; the pure potentialities of that which is to be manifested afterwards is called _tat matra_ – the essence of the physical world. These are known as the potentiality for hearing, for seeing, for touching, for tasting, for smelling; in Sanskrit they are called _sabda, sparsa, rupa, rasa, gandha_. They are not processes of the senses such as hearing; they are the potentialities which make it possible for us to see, or hear, or touch, etc. These potentialities get condensed in a particular form, called _panchakarana_. They become actual physical elements of earth, water, fire, air, ether; this is the world before us.
I have described the whole process of creation. Indriyebhyaḥ parā hy arth paraḥ_._ Of course, the senses are a reality for us, but the first step in yoga is knowing the objects which stand by themselves as pure primary qualities – with whom we have to think and with whom we have to be in harmony.
This is a very difficult subject. I am trying to purify your mind, and make you semi-divine at least, if not entirely divine. You will feel surprised that you are living in a different world altogether than what you are seeing with your eyes.
Mātā dhātā pitāmahaḥ (Gita 9.17). In the Bhagavadgita Sri Krishna Bhagavan says, “I am the father, I am the mother, I am the grandfather, I am the protector, I am the refuge, I am everything for you. Come on, I shall take care of you.”
This happens when you stand with the things of the world. Never look at them as if they are to be exploited by your perception. These ideas of enjoying them, taking them, repelling them must go. So, I have told you only the first step in yoga – but it is such a tremendous step that it will revolutionise your whole life. You will digest your food better, you will speak nicely, you will become a friend of all people, and the whole world will protect you. Be happy. God bless you.
