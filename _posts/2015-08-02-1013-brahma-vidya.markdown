**Brahma Vidya**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Dialogues From The Upanishads**](http://www.dlshq.org/books/es78.htm#intro) **by** [**Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/siva.htm)
**Om Sri Sadguru Paramatmane Namah**
The way of the Universe is a knotty and vexed problem that has defied all human skill for its proper solution. It has not been satisfactorily explained by any of the Acharyas, Rishis and Seers of Truth. Srutis and Smritis are silent on this point. The origin and nature of Maya can only be understood after attaining Brahma Jnana, when the Antahkarana is absolutely pure. Brahma Jnana is an occult mystery, a subject for initiation by a real Guru.
Now, just pause for a moment and think quite seriously your mode of life. You are proud that you are wise, and that you know science, arts, law, medicine, etc. Are you really prudent? Emphatically not. You are helplessly ignorant. In how many diverse wombs have you been placed? You have been swindled wholesale by the fleshy eye and the nervous tongue. You are carried away hopelessly by a little bit of colour, taste and touch.
Now, awake, arise and stop not till the goal of Elysial Bliss, final Beatitude, or the Turiyatita state, or Nirvikalpa absorption in Brahman or Videha Kaivalya is reached. Develop the sixfold virtues (Shat-sampat). Acquire the four qualifications. Remove the three kinds of impurities of the mind, viz., Mala (by Nishkama Karma, Japa, Tapa, Yama, Niyama, etc.), Vikshepa or tossing of mind (by Upasana of conditioned Brahman) and Avarana or layer (by Satsanga, study of Atma Jnana books, Vedantic scriptures, ceaseless Atmic enquiry or Vichara). Have faith first in yourself, then in Guru’s words and in the Srutis. Lead quite a simple life with sublime thoughts and lofty ideals. Eliminate desire and attachment, the two root causes of Samsara, the two potent factors of bondage. Have constant Satsanga, a rare panacea for the cure of the formidable disease of rebirth.
Just as the coloured water penetrates freely and nicely a piece of cloth when it is pure white, so also the instructions of a sage can penetrate and settle down in the hearts of aspirants only when their minds are calm, when there are no desires for enjoyments and when the impurities of their minds are destroyed. That is the reason why an aspirant is expected to possess the qualifications of Viveka, Vairagya, Sama, Dama and Uparati before he practises hearing of Srutis, reflection and meditation. Discipline and purification of the mind and the Indriyas are the prerequisites of an aspirant in the path of Truth and Self-realisation.
Knowledge is power. A doctor who has knowledge of medicine, of the physical machine and its workings, of therapeutics, and of diagnosis and treatment of diseases is a powerful man. He can influence thousands. A lawyer who has knowledge of law has got influence and power. The Commander-in-chief and Field-marshal who have knowledge of manoeuvres and enveloping movements of the battlefield and of the tactics of war have wonderful influence and power. The whole armies stand electrified before them and are ready to obey their commands. The raising of the policeman’s fingers stops all motor cars in the streets of London. Just as heat is inseparable from fire, so also power is inseparable from knowledge. Brahman, the source of Maya is the storehouse for all powers. A Jnani who has knowledge of Brahman has got tremendous powers. He wills through his Satsankalpa and everything comes into being.
Kill out all desires of life (Abhinivesa) in this world. Clinging to earth-life is the root cause of birth and death. Destroy the idea or the sense of separateness. Separateness is death. Unity is eternal life. Separateness is Avidya or ignorance. Unity is Jnana.
Unless a man perseveres seriously in the pursuit of Knowledge of the Self and unless a man struggles hard in the spiritual path with intense Vairagya and keen longing for liberation, he will never take recourse to Satsanga or company of sages and will never lend a willing ear to spiritual instructions, sermons and discourses.
There are no Vedantic Prakriyas (categories) in Upanishads. You will have to study Atma Bodha, Tattva Bodha, Vivekachudamani, Vedanta Sara, Laghu Vasudeva Manana in the beginning. These are all Prakriya Granthas. Then you will be able to understand clearly the teachings of Upanishads. A knowledge of three bodies, five Kosas, four Avasthas, three Gunas, Neti-neti doctrine, Bhaga-tyaga Lakshana, Anvaya-vyatireka, Adhyaropa-apavada, Layachintana of Om, Layachintana of Antahkarana, Layachintana of elements, Rajju-sarpa Nyaya, various Drishtantas, and Vadas like Drishti-srishti Vada, Vivarta Vada is indispensable requisite for proper understanding of Brahman. An elementary knowledge of Indian Logic, Nyaya philosophy is also necessary for proper understanding of Vedanta.
