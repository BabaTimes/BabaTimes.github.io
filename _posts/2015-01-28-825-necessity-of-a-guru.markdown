**Necessity of a Guru**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Yoga and Realisation**](http://www.dlshq.org/discourse/jul2014.htm) **by** [**Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/siva.htm)

Om! Om! Om!

Just as you can give an orange to a man, so also spiritual powers can be transmitted by one to another. This method of transmitting spiritual powers is ‘Sakti Sanchar.’

Birds keep their eggs under their wings. Through heat the eggs are hatched. Even so, spiritual power is transmitted by the Guru to the proper disciple, whom he considers fit for Sakti Sanchar, through touch (Sparshanat) like birds, sight like fish, and thinking or willing (Mananat, Sankalpa) like tortoise.

The transmitter, the Yogi Guru, sometimes enters the astral body of the selected particular student and elevates his mind through his power. The Yogi makes the subject (Chela) sit in front of him and asks him to close his eyes and then transmits his spiritual power. The subject feels the electric current actually passing from Moola-Chakra higher up to the neck and top of the head.

The disciple does various Hatha Yogic Kriyas, Asanas, Pranayamas, Bandhas, Mudras, etc., by himself. The student must not restrain his Ichha Sakti. He must act according to the inner Prerana (inner goading or stirring). The mind is highly elevated. The moment the aspirant closes his eyes, meditation comes by itself. Through Sakti Sanchar Kundalini is awakened by the grace of the Guru in the suitable disciple. Sakti Sanchar comes through Parampara. It is a hidden mystic science. It is handed down from the Guru to the disciple.

The disciple should not rest satisfied with the transmission of power from the Guru. He will have to struggle hard in Sadhana for further perfection and attainments. Lord Jesus through touch transmitted his spiritual power to some of his disciples (master’s touch). Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa touched Swami Vivekananda. Swami Vivekananda had superconscious experience. He struggled hard for seven years more even after the touch for attaining perfection. Lord Krishna touched the blind eyes of Vilvamangal (Surdas). The inner eye of Surdas was opened. He had Bhava Samadhi. Lord Gauranga through his touch produced divine intoxication in many people and converted them to his side. Atheists even danced in ecstasy in the streets by his touch and sang songs of Hari. Glory, glory to such exalted Yogic Gurus! May their blessings be upon us all!!

Sakti Sanchar is of two kinds, viz., lower and higher one. The lower one is a Jada-kriya only, wherein one automatically does Asana, Bandhas and Mudras without any instructions when the Guru imparts the power to the student. The student will have to take up Sravana, Manana, Nididhyasana for perfection. He cannot depend upon the Kriya alone. This Kriya is only an auxiliary. It gives a push to the Sadhaka.

A fully developed Yogi only possesses the highest kind of Sakti-Sanchar.
