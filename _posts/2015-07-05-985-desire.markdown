**Desire**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Bhakti Sutras of Narada**](http://www.sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&section_id=1122) **by** [**Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/siva.htm)

Why does desire manifest? On account of Avidya or ignorance or imperfection or lack of bliss. When one gets Darshan of God, all desires are burnt up. When the boy Dhruva had Darshan of Lord Hari, the desire to obtain kingdom that prompted him to worship, disappeared. Devotion is a fire like _Jnanagni_ (fire of wisdom) that burns up all mundane desires.

How can a trace of earthly desire remain when the devotee attains God, the embodiment of bliss? Darshan of God comes in various ways viz. , in dreams, in physical form with four hands, with conch, mace, discus and lotus-flower in the hands, in the form of cosmic consciousness (Visvarupa Darshan) which Arjuna had, in the form of Hiranyagarbha consciousness or full knowledge of Brahma- loka, etc. Note how Arjuna expresses his experiences of cosmic consciousness: "Nor source, nor midst, nor end; infinite force, unnumbered arms, the sun and moon Thine eyes; I see Thy face, as sacrificial fire, blazing, its splendour burneth up the worlds. "

God sometimes gives Darshan to encourage His devotees by coming down in Vimana (or celestial car). Akasa Vani, dazzling lights in space or sky are some other encouragements which God gives to push His devotees on the path vigorously and rapidly. The devotee should not stop his Sadhana on account of false _Tushti_ (satisfaction) when he gets His Darshan. He should ever rest in God. He should have perfect _Nishtha_ in God always (Svaroopa-sthiti). He should not leave off his practices till he merges himself in the Lord-_Maha-Bhava_ or _Tanmaya_ State (Parama Prem).

The devotee who realises God is freed from grief also. Can darkness remain in the presence of light? How can sorrow manifest when one is immersed in the Ocean of Bliss and Prem? Grief is a mental creation. It manifests when the mind is attached to body and illusory connections. When the mind is obliterated, when there is Self-absorption and self-effacement by merging in the bosom of God, how can grief approach the devotee? Absolutely impossible. The devotee does not hate anything. Hatred is due to ignorance. How can the devotee hate anybody when he sees Lord Hari in everything? He feels that the world is manifestation of the Lord and all movements and actions are His Lilas. He has no _Ghrina_ or dislike for faecal matter, dirt, Chandala, scavenger, cobbler, beggar, prostitute, thief, etc. He says: "I see everywhere my sweet Lord. It is Hari who is playing the part of prostitute, thief, dacoit, scavenger". He has an all-embracing, all-inclusive, exalted mental state. This cannot be adequately described in words. It has to be felt. Mira, Gouranga, Hafiz, Tulasi Das, Kabir, Ram Das all enjoyed this state. Tulasi Das says: _"Shiyaram maya sab jaga jane, karahu pranam jory juge pani_-Know everything as Siyaram, Sita and Rama, and with folded hands do prostrations to all, to everything. "

In Purusha Sukta you will find a description of the Purusha: "The Purusha has one thousand heads, one thousand eyes, one thousand feet. " There is an echo of these ideas in the Gita (XIII-13): "With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and mouths everywhere, with ears everywhere, He exists in the worlds enveloping all". Lord Krishna gives advice to Uddhava and prescribes an easy way for reaching Him. "Know, Uddhava, that Brahmin, Chandala, ass, dog, king, beggar are all My forms. When you meet any object, do prostration and feel My presence". Nama Dev said to the dog: "O Vittala, my dear in the form of dog, do not run away with the dry bread. It will affect your soft throat. Pray, let me apply ghee to the bread". He ran with ghee in a cup to the dog. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa prostrated before an outcaste girl: "O Mother Kaali! I see Thee in this girl. " Pavhari Baba prostrated before a thief with a bag of utensils: "O thief Narayan! Pray, accept these things, I never knew that thief Narayan was in my cottage". Ekanath, a Maharashtra Bhakta gave his ring voluntarily to a thief when he entered the house: "O thief! Take this ring also. Your _kartavya_ (duty) is to steal the things. Thou art Vittala (Krishna). Keep up this _Lila_. " Have you understood the sublime state of these exalted Bhaktas who have a new angle of vision? A day will come to you also. Exert. Struggle. Pray. Worship. Meditate. Plunge yourself in Bhajan with zeal, earnestness and fervour.

Give up this unquenchable thirst for sensual pleasure, woman, money and worldly prosperity which is the greatest obstacle in the path of devotion and turn your mind towards God. Here is an inexhaustible and imperishable spiritual wealth which no dacoit can rob and a Divine Bliss which is not mixed with fear or pain.
