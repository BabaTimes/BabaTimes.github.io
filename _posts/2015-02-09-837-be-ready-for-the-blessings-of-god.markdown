**Be Ready For The Blessings of God**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Meditation and Ashram Life**](http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/disc/disc_260.html) **by Sri Swami Krishnananda**
Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj was fond of a story about Darius of Persia. Darius was a minister who became king later on, but he began life as a shepherd. In Persian and Middle East regions, a shepherd’s clothes were usually tattered, dirty and torn due to poverty and so on. Some good luck struck Darius, due to which he became a minister of the king of Persia, and he was such an able administrator that he became a favourite of the king. The king was fond of him and consulted him on even the smallest of matters. The king had no confidence in any other person and always consulted Darius.
The other courtiers did not like this. They said, “Look at this, one person being pampered so much and enjoying so much favouritism. This man must be put down.” The courtiers hatched a plan. It so happened that whenever this minister went on an errand for his duties, he used to ride a camel. In Persia camels were used for riding. Whenever Darius went, he used to carry a small box which was tied behind him. Nobody knew what this box contained. Every day he carried this box.
The courtiers found out and thought he was a thief: “The king thinks that Darius is a very wonderful man. What is this he is carrying every day?” They went to the king and said, “My Lord, Your Highness, you are thoroughly mistaken. This fellow is a rogue. He has come to deceive you.”
“Why? What do you mean?” asked the king.
“We will tell you. Have you observed that every day he carries a trunk with him? Wherever he goes, there is a trunk behind him. What is it that he’s carrying? Such a secret thing he is carrying; nobody can open it, and he doesn’t show it to anybody. He carries the most valuable treasures of your kingdom, and he doesn’t want to leave it at home so that others may come and investigate. So whenever he goes, he takes that box with him. Ask him to bring the box and let him open it in your presence. You will see the truth of it.”
The king was shocked. “Darius is like this? I never thought so. It cannot be. Oh, I can’t believe it.”
Then the courtiers brought the king outside and said, “See. This is the trunk on the camel’s back.” The king did not believe his eyes. Anyhow, when ten people say a thing we cannot simply refuse or deny it.
The king called the minister and said, “My dear friend, can you just show me what is inside the box?”
Darius immediately sensed what had happened. This had never been uttered by the king up to this time. He said, “Your Highness, it is a wonderful treasure,” and he brought it down and opened it before the courtiers. “Here is the treasure of the kingdom, my friends, for which you have been after me.” Inside were his old, tattered shepherd clothes he had worn once upon a time when he was a boy. He told the king and the courtiers, “This is my real property. This I really am, even today. I am quitting this palace today, Your Highness. Enough of your hospitality for me.” He took the clothes, and left the palace. “I realise this condition of mine, and I have come to that condition, and I am leaving.” He put on those tattered clothes before all people, and left the palace. But then, of course, God blessed him. God would not leave him like that, and he became king afterwards.
Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj was fond of this story, and it was also published in the Divine Life Magazine to show where we stand and what can happen to us. Let no one imagine that he is safe and secure in this world – not you, not me, not anyone else, not even a grandfather. No one can be secure ultimately. Not even a Napoleon was secure, not even a Caesar. No one was secure in this world. Everyone has his day, and it is wisdom on the part of everyone to be ready for the blessings of God that may come in any form we like. But it is essential we should be honest in this attitude of ours.
God bless you.
