**Rise above Desire and Anger**

**(Kama and Krodha)**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Commentary on The Bhagavadgita**](http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/bgita/bgita_07.html) **by** [**Sri Swami Krishnananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/krishnananda.htm)

Knowingly, as it were, people commit mistakes. Though they are learned and have an insight into the knowledge of the scriptures, they are likely to take the erroneous path. What is the reason behind this mistake that human beings are subjected to?”

_Kāma eṣa krodha eṣa rajoguṇa samudbhavaḥ, mahāśano mahāpāpmā viddhyenam iha vairiṇam_ (3.37). Our enemy is our own self, the lower self, which is conditioned entirely with the sentiments of love and hatred. In the verses of the Second Chapter, which we have already studied, it is mentioned how desire arises in terms of objects, and when a desire arises in terms of objects there is simultaneous anger in regard to that which is likely to be a hindrance in the fulfilment of the desire. Therefore, when there is a desire, there is anger, either potential or manifest. Even if it is not manifest, there is a susceptibility to anger in regard to a possible hindrance that may arise in the fulfilment of a desire. Hence, love and hatred go together. _Kama_ and _krodha_ go together.

_Kāma eṣa krodha eṣa rajoguṇa samudbhavaḥ_. Born of the intense agitation of _prakriti’s_ nature, due to the agitation of the _rajasic_ quality of the mind and the intense disturbance on the surface of the psyche, there is the impetuous activity of the sense organs in the direction of other people and other things in the world, with whom we deal in a manner which is always partial and never wholesome. It is always partial because of the fact that we can never have a judicious understanding of the total structure of anything in this world. Our knowledge is fractional. We are not _tattvavit_; we do not know the relation between the _gunas_ of _prakriti_ and action. So we are pulled in the direction of self-destruction. As a moth flies into the blazing flame under the impression that it is beautiful, and is reduced to ashes, the flames of desire which burn through the sense organs compel the individual soul to fly to the objects of sense, thereby losing its understanding and, sometimes, its very existence itself.

This impulse has to be restrained. We should not get angry. Actually, anger is a sign of absence of even culture, let alone spiritual insight. An uncultured person gets agitated over silly things. Anger is the worst of enemies. Let it not take possession of you.

Hanuman got very angry in Lanka. Sita’s predicament roused his anger to such an extent that he thought, “I should go from here only after teaching a lesson to Ravana.” So he rose up into a mountainous shape, and destroyed the whole of Lanka by setting fire to it. Afterwards he cooled down a bit. He began to feel, “What a wretched act I have done! Anger is the worst of enemies. How is it that I got into a rage of this kind and set fire everywhere, not thinking that perhaps Sita may also be burned? If this has happened, I shall not go back to Rama. I shall stay here itself, do _prayopavesha_ and end my life.”

He is a hero who, knowing that fire-like anger is rising up, subdues it with the power of the will. Such a person is a hero, and not merely one who carries a weapon in his hand. _Kama_ and _krodha_ are the worst of enemies. They are hindrances in the spiritual advancement of the spirit because their main activity is to violate the very consciousness of universality through the sense organs that work on the basis of _kama_ and _krodha_, desire and anger. How are we going to subdue these forces?

If we want to get a license or a permit, we can apply to the government in two ways. There is a method of approaching through the proper channels. The nearest official is approached and the application is submitted; and that person endorses it and gives to the next official, until finally the supreme authority endorses it and the permit is granted. The other method is to go directly to the supreme authority, if it is practicable and possible for us, and then an immediate order is issued and is communicated to all the subordinate officials automatically, spontaneously, instead of the routine, stereotyped method of rising gradually over a period of time.

So is the instruction of Bhagavan Sri Krishna in the manner of controlling these impulses of _kama_ and _krodha_. We can go gradually from the lower level of restraint to the higher level, or we can touch the top and put the whole force down with one action. A person who is subject to intense passions and anger may do well to fast one day in a week. Or if he is more sincere and honest, he may miss a meal every day because then his impulses will know that if they start creating too much havoc, they will miss a meal, so they will be cautious in manifesting themselves. Restrain yourself through habits of food. Have only a _sattvic_ diet, and not _rajasic_ and _tamasic_ diets. Fast one day in a week, or miss a meal every day. That is one method.

The other method is, as far as possible, to try to avoid the company of people who are not in any way going to be of help to you or are going to be a disturbance to you. Atheists and materialists or opponents of any kind may not be good company for you. Be alone to yourself. Try to be alone to yourself as much as possible, and be in the midst of people only to that extent as would be necessitated by the work that you perform. You may be a teacher, you may be a factory manager, you may be a medical person, or you may be professor, etc. You may be in the midst of society only to the extent to which you have to fulfil your obligations—not more, not less. Reduce your contact with people to the minimum by a judicious analysis of the requirements of human society. Thus, diet is one method, and social contact is another.

The third is the study of spiritual books such as the Bhagavata, the Bhagavadgita, the Upanishads, etc. This should be done every day, in the early morning, so that you start the day with the noble thoughts of Vyasa or Valmiki or Bhagavan Sri Krishna or Jesus Christ or whoever it is. The intense nobility and the profundity of these spiritual teachings which have gone into your mind due to your _svadhyaya_ in the morning will, to some extent, restrain your behaviour throughout the day.

Lastly, there is meditation and _japa_. As much time as possible must be devoted to meditation and _japa_. The sense organs are weakened by these methods, and weak minds cannot wreak as much havoc and are not as rapacious as they are when they have strength.

_Indriyāṇi mano buddhir asyādhiṣṭhānam ucyate_ (3.40). The forces of _kama_ and _krodha_ have a location in your body. They are the sense organs, the _manas_ and the _buddhi_. Your reason, your mind and your sense organs are the instruments which are harnessed by the forces of _kama_ and _krodha_ to achieve their purpose. So the lower category may be controlled first, and the higher category afterwards. The sense organs may be restrained first by the means that I mentioned in brief. Then you can control the mind gradually by _japa sadhana_. As direct meditation is very difficult, the mind can be restrained by _japa sadhana_, _purascharana_, etc. Then the _buddhi_ is restrained by higher meditation.

This is a procedural method of the application from the lower orders to the higher orders. But there is a direct method of subjugating the sense organs, which is the rousing of the aspiration of the soul for establishing itself in Universal Consciousness. This is called the rousing of the _brahmakara vritti_ in the mind. A _vritti_ is a modification of the mind. Ordinarily there is a _visayakara vritti_ in your mind. A modification of the mind in terms of the objects of sense is called _visayakara vritti_, but the modification of the mind in terms of Universal Existence is called _brahmakara vritti_. When you try to analyse the interrelationships of the circumstances of life, you will notice that everything is connected to everything else. Therefore, any particular passion or anger in regard to an object is not permitted. This kind of meditation, which is your attempt to locate or fix your consciousness on a universal concept, will immediately put a check on the instinctive activities of the mind and, secondarily, on the impetuous activities of the sense organs.

_indriyāṇi parāṇyāhur indriyebhyaḥ paraṁ manaḥ_  
 _manasas tu parā buddhir yo buddheḥ paratas tu saḥ_ (3.42)  
 _evaṁ buddheḥ paraṁ buddhvā saṁstabhyātmānam ātmanā_  
 _jahi śatruṁ mahābāho kāmarūpaṁ durāsadam_ (3.43)

These last verses of the Third Chapter are like medicine, a prescription by a doctor, which you may repeat every day. The _indriyas_ are strong, no doubt, but the sense organs being strong does not mean that they are the only authorities in the world. The mind is stronger than the sense organs. The intellect, or the higher reason, is stronger than the instinctive mind. Higher than the reason is the strength of this Universal Spirit, which you really are. So try to root yourself gradually by the process of self-analysis, through which you realise the interconnection of all things, on account of which particular love and hatred cannot be sanctioned in this world. There cannot be desire for something or hatred for something. _Kama_ and _krodha_ can be subjugated in this way by a direct push that you give from the top, from the Atman that is universal. When the order from the universal Atman is communicated to the _buddhi_, it communicates that order into the mind, and the mind communicates the order to the sense organs, and puts a check on their activities. _Kama_ and _krodha_ cease. This is how you may control these hindrances to spiritual practice. So concludes the Third Chapter of the Bhagavadgita.
