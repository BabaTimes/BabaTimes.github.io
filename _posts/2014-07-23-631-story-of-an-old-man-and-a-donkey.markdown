**Story of an Old Man and a Donkey**
_(You cannot please the world)_
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Yoga in Daily Life**](http://www.dlshq.org/download/yogadaily.htm#_VPID_109) **by Sri Swami Sivananda**
An old man was riding a donkey, while he was returning from a Sunday fair. His young son was walking. The passers-by saw this and remarked: “Look at this cruel fellow. The young boy is walking all along. This stout man is riding on the donkey. Merciless wretch!” As soon as the old man heard these harsh words, he got down from the donkey and put his boy on the donkey. Some other people who were passing along the road saw this and remarked: “Loot at this cruel boy. The old, weak man is walking. Cheeky, arrogant, young, stout boy is enjoying a ride. Cruel boy!” Then the old man also got upon the donkey. They both rode the old animal. Some other people criticised: “Look at these two cruel fellows. The animal is old and weak. These two stout fellows are riding. Both are very, very cruel and heartless indeed!” They both got down and allowed the animal to walk freely. Some other passers-by remarked: “Look at these two fools. They have no brains. There is a good animal. They can quite easily ride and enjoy. They are walking now.” Thus the old man was kicked and tossed about from both sides, like a drum.
If you marry, people will say that you are a passionate man. If you remain unmarried, people will say that you are a eunuch or impotent man. If you perform Japa, Sandhya, people will remark that you are a great religious hypocrite. If you do not perform Sandhya they will still criticise you and say that you are an atheist. You can never please the world.
Bhima advised Yudhishthira: “O Dharmaputra, you can never please the world.” Be above the Dvandva of Ninda and Stuthi, censure and praise. Do not bother yourself. Have no fear of public opinion. Rest in Samata.”
Fear of public opinion is a great weakness. One may not be afraid of the knife of surgeons. He may submit himself fearlessly to extraction of a strong tooth without cocaine-injection or to an operation without chloroform. One may not have the least fear for wild animals in thick forests; he may move about fearlessly in forests. One may not be afraid of the machine gun in the battlefield; he may fearlessly expose his chest to the bullets. Such fearless people may be afraid of slight public criticisms! They may even die of such criticisms. He who is leading a spiritual life, who has outgrown society’s fragile man-made rules, must be above public opinion and criticisms. He will have to hear the shrill pure, inner voice within, the voice of the soul and follow this voice at all costs, despite public criticisms of all sorts.
Many spiritually great men have given up their lives to keep up their convictions in the path of Truth. You can grow spiritually if you are above public opinion. Mark how Gandhiji stuck tenaciously to his principles despite public criticisms. Even if the whole world opposes you, you will have to stick to your principles and fight out, single-handed, even if it be.
