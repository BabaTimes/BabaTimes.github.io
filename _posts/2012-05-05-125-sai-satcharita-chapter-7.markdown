Sai Satcharita Chapter 7

* * *

Shri Sai Baba was a good and tolerant Guru. He believed that as long as people were pure of heart and pious in their beliefs, God would be good to them. He did not like to differentiate between religions or sects, and liked to participate in any functions that praised the Lord. Hindus, Christians, and Muslims prostrated before Baba, asking for his blessings. He treated all people in the same manner, and let his love flow through each person that received his _darshan_.



Sai Baba was proficient in many forms of Yoga, and liked to use His practices to help the people that believed in Him.



While Baba was sitting near the _dhuni_ (holy fire) in His mosque one day, He reached for a log to push into the fire. But instead of a log, He pushed His arm into the fire, which burned and scorched immediately. Baba’s followers came running towards Him, and dragged him away from the fire, asking Him why He had done such a thing. Baba replied that He had sensed that the wife of a blacksmith was near a fire in her home. She had been in a hurry and slipped near the fire, dropping her child into the furnace. Baba thrust his hand into the _dhuni_ to save the child. His followers were amazed as to see the love and mercy of the Lord.



Leela, the wife of one of Baba’s devotees, was worried for the health of her son, who was suffering with the Bubonic Plague. She went to Baba, and told Him that she was scared that her son may not be able to survive the disease. Baba told her that illness would pass, just as the clouds in the sky would move away, revealing the sun behind them. Saying this, He lifted up His _kafni,_ showing her the bubbles of pus on His chest. Baba smiled and said that He suffered for His devotees, and that their difficulties were His. Baba suffered for all that believed in Him because He believed in their devotion and the love that they showed for Him.
