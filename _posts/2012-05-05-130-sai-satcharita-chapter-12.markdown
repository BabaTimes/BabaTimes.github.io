Sai Satcharita Chapter 12

* * *

Babas devotee, Kaka Mahajani, once went to Shirdi from Bombay for the _Gokul Ashtami_ festival. He wanted to stay there for a week, when Baba called him near and asked when he would be returning home. He was surprised at this question, but he answered saying that he wished to leave Shirdi in a week’s time. Baba told him to leave the next day, which he followed. When he returned to Bombay, it turned out that his employer was waiting for him and that his job was in jeopardy. Baba had forseen this and told him to leave Shirdi immediately so that he could reach Bombay in time to save his job.



Another story in which Baba’s word changed a man’s life was in the instance of Moolay Shastri, a Brahmin from Nasik. Moolay Shastri went for Baba’s _darshan_ in His mosque with the magistrate of the town and a few friends. Moolay Shastri did not enter the masjid because he did not think that it was a pure or sacred place. But when he started to throw flowers at Baba’s feet, the image before him transformed into his Guru, whom Moolay Shastri trusted and loved. He was taken aback, and thought he was dreaming, but the image did not change. Then, Moolay Shastri bowed in front of Baba and sang the _aarti_ with His other devotees, leaving all doubts at Baba’s feet.
