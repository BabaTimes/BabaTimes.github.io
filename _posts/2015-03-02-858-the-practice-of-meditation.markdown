**The Practice of Meditation**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Dhyana Yoga**](http://www.dlshq.org/books/es33.htm) **by** [**Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/siva.htm)

Dhyana or meditation is in the keeping up of the flow of one idea with a continuity as unbroken as the flow of oil. Meditation is of two kinds, viz., concrete and abstract. If you meditate on any picture or concrete object it is concrete meditation. If you meditate on an abstract idea, on any quality such as mercy, tolerance, it is abstract meditation. A beginner should practise concrete meditation. For some aspirants, abstract meditation is more easy than concrete meditation.

The practice of meditation must start only after one is well established in Pratyahara or abstraction of the senses and concentration. If the senses are turbulent, if the mind cannot be fixed on one point, no meditation is possible even within hundreds of years. One should go stage by stage, step by step. The mind should be withdrawn again and again and fixed upon the object of meditation. Its tendency to run and roam must be checked. One should reduce one’s wants and renounce all sorts of wild, vain desires from the mind. A desireless man alone can sit quiet and practise meditation. Sattvic and light diet and Brahmacharya are the prerequisites for the practice of meditation.

Consciousness is of two kinds, viz., focussing consciousness and marginal consciousness. When you concentrate on Trikuti, the space midway between the eyebrows, your focussing consciousness is on the Trikuti. When some flies sit on your left hand during meditation, you drive them with your right hand. When you become conscious of the flies it is called marginal consciousness. A seed which has remained in the fire for a second will not undoubtedly sprout into leaves even though sown in a fertile soil. Even so a mind that does meditation for some time but runs towards sensual objects on account of unsteadiness will not bring in the full fruits of Yoga.

Beginners on the spiritual path should remember again and again some important and inspiring Vedantic statements, every day. Only then can their doubts be removed and they would find themselves established on the path. Some of these statements are: "Being alone was in the beginning, one without a second" Chhandogya Upanishad VI-2-1; "In the beginning all this was the one Self alone" Aitareya Upanishad VI-2-1; "This is the Brahman, without cause and without effect; this Self is Brahman perceiving everything" Brihadaranyaka Upanishad II-5-19; "That immortal Brahman alone is" Mandukya Upanishad, II-2-7. This immortal Atman cannot be attained without constant practice of meditation. Therefore he who wishes to attain immortality and freedom should meditate on the Self or the Brahman, for a long time.

The Self or the Atman is the fountain-source of all energy. Thinking on Atman as the Source of all Energy, is a dynamic method for augmenting one’s own energy, strength and power. If you think even for a single second, of the all-pervading pure, immortal Satchidananda Atman or Brahman, it would be tantamount to taking thousand and eight dips in the sacred Triveni—the junction of holy rivers at Prayag. This is the real mental sacred bath. Physical bath is nothing when compared to this internal bath of wisdom or knowledge.

Worship the Self or the Atman with the flowers of Jnana or wisdom, contentment, peace, joy and equal vision. This will constitute real worship. Offerings of rose, jasmine, sandal paste, incense, sweetmeats and fruits are nothing when compared to the offerings of Jnana, contentment, peace, equal vision. These are the offerings given by the ignorant persons. Try to identify yourself with the eternal, immortal, ever-pure Atman or Soul that resides in the chambers of your heart. Think and feel always: "I am the very pure Atman. This one thought will remove all troubles and fanciful thoughts. The mind wants to delude you when it detracts you from the central purpose of your life, viz., meditation on the Atman. Therefore start an anti-current of thought against the tendencies of the mind. Then, mind will lurk like a thief and become submissive.

In the Yoga-Vasishtha you will find: "The right course to be adopted by one who is a novitiate is this: Two parts of the mind must be filled with the objects of enjoyments, one part with philosophy and the remaining part with devotion to the teacher. Having advanced a little, he should fill one part of the mind with the object of enjoyment, two parts with devotion to the teacher and the remaining one with getting an insight into the meaning of philosophy. When one has attained proficiency, he should every day fill two parts of his mind with philosophy and supreme Renunciation, and the remaining two parts with meditation and devoted service to the Guru." This will eventually lead you on to meditation for twenty-four hours. Meditate ceaselessly upon that Satchidananda Brahman and attain the Supreme immaculate seat in this very life.
