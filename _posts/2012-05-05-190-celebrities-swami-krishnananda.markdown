# **Swami Krishnananda**  

* * *

Swami Krishnananda Saraswati (April 25, 1922 – November 23, 2001) was a Hindu saint. He was a disciple of Swami Sivananda and served as the General Secretary of the Divine Life Society in Rishikesh, India from 1958 until 2001. Author of more than 200 texts, and lecturing extensively, on yoga, religion, and metaphysics, Krishnananda was a prolific theologian and philosopher.

Swami Krishnananda was President of the Sivananda Literature Research Institute and the Sivananda Literature Dissemination Committee. He served as editor of the Divine Life Society’s monthly paper, Divine Life, for 20 years.

### **Early life**

The eldest of six children, Swami Krishnananda was born on April 25, 1922, into a highly religious and an orthodox [Madhva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhva "Madhva") [Brahmin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin "Brahmin") family. He was named Subbaraya by his parents. He was educated at the high school in Puttur, Karnataka.

By the study of Sanskrit works like the Gita, the Upanishads, and the Vedas, Swami Krishnananda became rooted in Advaita Vedanta philosophy, though he belonged to the traditional Madhva-sect (Dvaita Vedanta), which follows the dualistic philosophy. In 1943, Subbaraya took up Government service at Hospet in the Bellary District, but it did not last long. Before the end of the same year, he left for Sivananda's ashram, the Divine Life Society (DLS). Sivananda initiated the young man into the holy order of Sannyasa (Hindu monasticism) on the Indian sacred day of Makar Sankranti, January 14, 1946, and he was named Swami Krishnananda.

### **Ashram life**

Krishnananda was initially engaged at the DLS in letter writing, writing messages and assistance in compiling and editing books. Later, he typed manuscripts produced by Sivananda, including the two hand-written volumes of the Brahma Sutras. In 1948, Sivananda asked him to write books on philosophy and religion; from then onwards he also conducted classes and lectures.

Krishnananda later worked with a committee that was established to improve the management of the DLS and at this time he became a Secretary, concerned especially with the management of finance. He continued this work until 1961, when, due to the extended absence of Swami Chidananda, then President of the DLS, Sivananda nominated him as General Secretary. He held that position until his death, at which time he was the longest serving General Secretary of the institution.

Sivananda appointed Krishnananda as President of the Sivananda Literature Research Institute when it was formed in 1958. Krishnananda was also appointed as the President of the Sivananda Literature Dissemination Committee, which was formed to bring out translations of Sivananda's works in the major Indian languages. In 1961, Krishnananda became editor of the DLS's monthly publication, Divine Life. He held the position for 20 years.

### **Death**

He died on November 23, 2001.
