**Invoke The Power of Vidya Maya**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**A New Beginning**](http://www.dlshq.org/download/new_beginning.pdf) **by Sri Swami Chidananda**

Everything that exists, everything that is, everything that is perceived by the five senses, everything that has ever been conceived of, we consider as the play of the supreme inscrutable power of Para Brahman, Maya. This great Divine Mother contains within Herself both light and darkness, auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, the positive and the negative, progression and regression, evolution and involution, upward ascent and downward descent, emancipation and liberation, and bondage and perdition. And it is this play of Hers composed of these dualities, these Dvandvas, that we see in this paradoxical universe of ours. It is a play now full of joy, now full of sorrow. It is a play full of birth and death, day and night, darkness and light, love and hate, like and dislike, attraction and repulsion. There is therefore the great need of invoking this supreme Cosmic Power of Para Brahman in Her benign, auspicious aspect, in Her creative, constructive, positive aspect, in Her progressive aspect, that She may Herself manifest in each

seeking soul, in each sincere aspiring soul, in the form of all that is positive, all that is good, all that is auspicious and blessed, all that is progressive. Thus manifesting, She Herself will enact Her divine play of overcoming all that is of darkness, of overcoming the opposing side of the downward pull. She is the downward pull and She is the force overcoming the downward pull.

She Herself is both. Invoked as Vidya Maya, she liberates. Therefore, we have this great need, this indispensable necessity to invoke the positive, the auspicious, the blessed, the liberating, the illuminating aspect of the Mother’s power in us¾not the enchanting, the binding, deluding or chaining aspect.

And this mid-point of this concluding month of the year would be indeed a very appropriate point in time to look back and try to study in retrospect what one’s life has been over these past eleven months, what one’s situation has led up to over these past eleven months, how far the living of one’s life over these months has helped to move towards the lofty, noble, sublime ideals one has set up before oneself for attainment.

Radiant souls! Devotees of the Lord! Lovers of righteousness! Beloved seekers engaged in a determined effort at self-unfoldment, in a resolute effort to uplift yourselves by your own selves! For, that is the injunction, that is the great Adesh of the world-teacher Bhagavan Sri Krishna: “Uplift thyself by thy own self. _Uddharet Atmanatmanam_”. Draw inspiration, draw guidance, draw light from all the directions if you wish, but the effort should be yours. Nothing can substitute for that. Guidance can come, light can come, encouragement can come, inspiration can come. But the effort has to be supplied by one’s own self. That effort is Purushartha. It is self-effort. All things in this universe from the most ancient times were achieved by earnestness and earnest effort, sincerity and dedication, persistence and perseverance. This self-effort constitutes a small price for the glorious attainment that is the outcome. This glorious attainment, this great attainment means life. And without this attainment, life is no life; it is living death. It is as good as not existing.

If we exist only to pass through time, we do not exist, we do not live. Mountains and rocks, and minerals in the bowels of the earth, pass through millions of years, pass through aeons; but what they were a million years ago, what they were ten million years ago, they are that even now. That is a state of never rising beyond or above one’s condition. The sole exception is when one comes into the level of animate life. And it is the privilege of man to be even more than animate life, to be conscious, intelligent and purposeful in the living of life. That is the supreme prerogative, the privilege of humankind of whom you are one, to which species you belong. The very hallmark of the human status is a clear perception, an intelligent comprehension of the goal of life, of the purpose for which you are being here; and also a

purposeful effort, a sustained effort towards the attainment of that great, grand and glorious goal. That is life. And the human individual is capable of this wonderful effort, this wonderful Purushartha, this purposeful and intelligent effort, precisely because he is divine.

It is the divinity of your being that will not rest content by your continuing to be active only upon the human level. It will not rest content. It will manifest itself. It is that which urges you to recapture once again and realize once again your true pristine splendour. It is that divinity within you, it is the fact of your divinity that urges you towards the restoration of the lost glorious kingdom, towards the awareness of your total perfection. This inner urge of the God in man towards God-consciousness is the only thing that is worthy of being called life. It is the only thing that deserves to be called life. This is the inner upward urge towards once again fully experiencing, fully realizing, that state of divinity that is our eternal, natural state, over which we have a birthright, a claim.

Time should not be allowed to pass by without doing something substantial in this upward ascent of the spirit towards cosmic consciousness, towards divine perfection, peace and joy. And, therefore, let us take stock of where we stand after having been given a whole year, of which eleven months have passed by and the last month is moving towards its close. Let us take stock and decide firmly, in the light of what we learn about ourselves, how we can utilize the next twelve months that are about to be proffered to us, about to be given to us, gifted to us, by God. Let us decide firmly in what manner the next year could be lived.
