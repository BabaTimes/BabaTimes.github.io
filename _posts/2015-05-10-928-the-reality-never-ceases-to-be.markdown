**The Reality Never Ceases To Be**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**The Gita Vision**](http://www.dlshq.org/download/gita_vision.htm#_VPID_9) **by** [**Sri Swami Chidananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/chida.htm)

Krishna tells him (Arjuna): "This idea of yours is because of your lack of knowledge; it is because of your ignorance. You are adducing arguments like a lawyer in a court of law. You are trying to argue with Me, but yet your mind is full of confusion and ignorance. That is why you are refusing to act. You think that you are going to kill someone. Who can kill whom? Do you know? These beings whom you, with your _sthula drishti,_ gross outer vision, characterised by unknowing and ignorance, think to be perishable beings whom you will destroy, do you know what they really are? They are immortal, imperishable, eternal. Weapons cannot injure them, fire cannot burn them, water cannot wet them, wind cannot dry them. They are unborn, eternal, beyond time. Who are you to say that you are going to kill something which is imperishable and immortal? One who says that he is killing someone or one who thinks that he is being killed, both of them are in ignorance. The Reality never ceases to be. And the unreal is never really there; it is only an appearance; it never exists. To think that you are sending something unreal out of existence is ignorance. So, first of all, clear your brain of _avidya,_ this _ajnana._ Have clear perception, know properly, understand properly. Then let us see whether you talk about killing, destroying, and all that."

Therefore, Lord Krishna, first and foremost, brings Arjuna to an awareness of his ignorance. He says: "O Arjuna, listen, this tendency of yours to run away from action is not the answer to your dilemma and your problem. You must open your eyes, have an inner understanding and see clearly. It is not a question of action and inaction. The wise thing is to know that there is a third way, which is the right and proper way, and that alone is the solution and answer to your present situation. And that way is wisdom-filled action.

"For it is ignorance that is making you feel this terrible way, and it is ignorance that is making you shy away from action. Let Me tell you one thing. Whether you want to or not, act you must. The very nature of this life on earth, the very nature of the human individual, is such that the drive to activity is inherent in that nature. And, whether you want it or not, you are part and parcel of this Cosmic Nature that has brought manifestation into being. The Cosmic Nature contains within Herself this inaccessible impulsion to action. Understand this clearly. Forcibly you will be made to engage in action.

"It is better, therefore, to prefer to act in a wisdom-filled manner and thus liberate yourself from the consequences of action, than to either engage in foolish action or foolishly try to give up all action. The choice is not just between the total giving up of action or acting with ignorance. There is a wise alternative choice, which is to act with knowledge and understanding. Such action cannot bind the individual. Such action goes beyond the operation of the law of action and the inevitable experience of the fruits of action. It is almost like engaging in action, yet being actionless. This is the great secret of action.

"Therefore, do not think that turning away from action and trying to merely become a mendicant, trying to go into a life of spiritual quest, a life of meditation and contemplation, is the only alternative, the only way out. Rather, here and now you have to elevate action to a higher dimension by bringing into it a clear knowledge of the realities of the human situation in this universe."
