**Attitude of Gratitude**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**The Great Drama of Creation**](http://swami-krishnananda.org/disc/disc_249.html) **by Sri Swami Krishnananda**
**(Spoken on June 22, 1997)**
You are intelligent, I am intelligent; we have intelligence in us. This intelligence is a drop of cosmic intelligence. Just as a drop of water is a part of the ocean, our intelligence, our intellectuality, our rationality, whatever it is, is a drop in the sea of the universal intelligence. We are called _jivas_, individuals, because of the droplet of intelligence that we have got; and the universal intelligence is God. So we cannot stand without it. Without the organic cooperative activity of the body, no limb can operate, and whatever we are today is due to a blessing we have received due to the good karma that we did in the past. If we are enjoying life today with status, with finance, with power, with good health, and everything is okay, it is because we have done some good deeds in the past. We cannot deserve comfort which we have not given to other people. There is no such thing as free service. It is not possible. All of you are great people today because you have done great deeds in the previous birth, though you may not remember what deeds you have done. Now, if you want to become still greater in the next birth, in this birth you must do good deeds because you are exhausting all your virtuous deeds of the previous birth by enjoying them this birth. What about the next birth? Whatever you have done now will come there. So you should not imagine from your individual point of view that everything is okay in one second.
We belong to a kingdom of heaven, as it is called. The kingdom of heaven is not in the skies. The whole universe is the kingdom of heaven, and we are living inside it. We are within it immanently. We are breathing it, we are enjoying it, we are happy because of that. The joys of life, the happiness we feel in our own heart is the _pura punya phala_, the result of good actions that we have performed. We have done great charities, great good deeds, and great services in the previous life. Therefore, now we are like a king. And if we want to become a greater king in our next birth, we must do some more work now in this birth.
What can be a greater service than prayer to the Almighty God? Be grateful. We have to show our gratitude to the Creator of the universe, and He will show us His willingness to serve us. It is difficult to get a thing in the world; it takes time. But to contact God it takes one second because eternity does not require time to come here. That is the blessing.
