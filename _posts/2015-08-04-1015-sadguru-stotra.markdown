**Sadguru Stotra**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Dialogues From The Upanishads**](http://www.dlshq.org/books/es78.htm#sadguru) **by** [**Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/siva.htm)
**Om Sri Sadguru Paramatmane Namah**
1. I bow to that Supreme Guru who assumed the forms of Lord Jesus, Lord Buddha, Lord Krishna, Lord Rama and Sri Sankara in times of catastrophe and high calamities to destroy wicked people and established righteousness on earth.
2. Salutations to that spotless Brahman, Who has hidden Himself like oil in seed, like butter in milk, but Who reveals Himself to those who practise constant and intense meditation after purifying their minds, by Tapas, continence, right conduct, etc.
3. Prostrations to the World-teacher, who removes the veil of ignorance of ignorant Jivas when they meditate on Him with one-pointed pure mind and who is an embodiment of love and mercy.
4. My silent adorations to the non-dual, pure, Self-effulgent, eternal, All-full, imperishable Brahman, who is the support of my body, mind, Prana and Indriyas, who is the light and substratum of this world, and who is the silent witness of all my mental states and modifications.
5. Hail, hail to that Sat-chit-ananda Atman who is unchanging, immutable, all-pervading like ether, without limbs, without body, Prana, senses and mind, and who is represented by the monosyllable Om.
6. Glory to that indivisible, infinite, immortal one essence that lies hidden in all these names and forms and that is known by the various names—Atman, Brahman, Chaitanya, Purusha, Paramatma Svarupa; Kutastha, Purushottama, etc.
7. Victory to that Brahman who is the source, womb, support, root for this world and my body, who is ever waking even when all the minds are resting in Mula Ajnana at night during deep sleep, who illumines the Buddhi, sun and all objects of the world, but who Himself is not in need of any other light on account of His Self-luminosity.
8. I bow to that Nirakara Nirguna Brahman who is like steam or H
