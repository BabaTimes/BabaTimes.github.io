**Dharma**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Ethical Teachings**](http://www.dlshq.org/books/es48.htm#dharma) **by** [**Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/siva.htm)

Etymologically, Dharma means ‘that which upholds’ this world or the people of this world, or the whole creation from microcosm to the macrocosm. It is the Eternal Divine Law of the Supreme Lord. The whole creation is held together by the all-powerful Law of God. Practice of Dharma, therefore, means to recognise these laws and abide by them.

That which leads to the goal is Dharma. That which leads to the path of perfection and pristine glory is Dharma. That which makes your life divine is Dharma. That which makes you to ascend unto Godhead is Dharma. That which helps you to have direct communion with the Lord is Dharma. God is the centre of Dharma. Dharma is the heart of Hindu Ethics. The principle of unity, righteousness and holiness is Dharma. It is your sole companion after death. It protects you after death, if you protect it now. If you transgress it now, your transgression will pursue even after your departure and destroy you. Therefore it is the sole refuge of humanity.

Dharma means the Achara or the regulation of life. Achara is the supreme Dharma. It is the basis of Tapas and austerity. It leads to wealth, beauty, longevity and continuity of lineage.

Dharma is given the foremost rank in the scriptures among the four Purusharthas, the grand objects of human aspirations. Through Dharma, the other three, Artha, Kama and Moksha come automatically to you, because, through the practice of Dharma alone one can achieve his goal of life and crown himself with eternal bliss and supreme peace.

The four Vedas, the Smriti-texts, the behaviour of those who have entered into their spirit and act according to their injunctions, the conduct of holy men and satisfaction of one’s own self—these are all the bases of Dharma. The only authority in the matter of Dharma is the Vedas.

That which is Dharma is verily the Truth. Truthfulness, contentment, self-restraint, non-stealing, purity, control of anger, discrimination between the right and wrong, between the real and the unreal, spiritual knowledge, control of the senses come under the general Dharma or the universal Dharma according to Manu.

As enumerated in Mahabharata the performance of Sraaddha or offering oblations to the forefathers, religious austerity, truth, restraint of anger, loyalty to and contentment with one’s own wife, purity, learning, absence of envy, knowledge of the Self and forbearance are the fundamentals of Dharma.

As detailed in Padma Purana, the six characteristics of Dharma are, the bestowing of gifts to deserving persons, fixing one’s thoughts on the Lord, adoration of one’s parents, offering a portion of the daily meal to all creatures and giving a morsel of food to cows.

All other religions also lay stress on Dharma. Buddhism, Christianity, Jainism, Sikhism and Islam are all remarkably alive to its value. Plato, Socrates, Aristotle are all striking examples in the history of the West in keeping up Dharma.

Dharma includes all external deeds as well as thoughts and other mental practices which tend to elevate the character of a man. Dharma comes from the Divine and leads you also to the Divine.

Follow the Dharma with zeal and enthusiasm! Discharge your duties well and attain the Supreme and enjoy the eternal bliss!
