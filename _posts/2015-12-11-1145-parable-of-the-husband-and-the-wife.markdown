**Parable of the Husband and the Wife**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Parables of Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/download/parables.htm#_VPID_106) **by Gurudev Sri Swami Sivanandaji**
There once happily lived a poor couple in a little village. Whenever the wife brooded over their poverty and pressed the husband to procure enough things to lead a decent life in uniformity with the rest of the villagers, the husband used to reply that the Lord loved them most and that is why He had kept them in that poor state. Through blandishment, coquetry and crocodile tears, the wife reduced the husband to a mere slave in the long run. One day she sent him to a generous friend of his, commanding him to offer a handful of water to his friend as a present. Without any alternative, the husband did the same. His generous friend, knowing fully well the devotee's poverty, amply rewarded the hands that offered a little water with love and devotion. But the poor man lost his devotional aspect and began to think, "If a little water can fetch me a handful of wealth, what I would have received, had I only offered a pot-full of water."
Sivananda Says:
Look into this Parable.
Thy Buddhi is like the husband, and thy physical being is like the wife. They are destined to live together happily like Man and Woman.
It is the duty of the wife to procure the little domestic needs. Her world is confined only to that. It is the duty of the husband to guide her and lead her properly. But, when the wife displays her crocodile tears, the husband loses his brain and trying to comfort her, willingly obeys her forgetting his own duty and integrity.
Thy physical being, too, craves for its little comforts. Your Viveka tries to convince it that they are useless. But, when it pleads and weeps before you, you allow it a little freedom and choice. Instead of trying to check it, you pacify it. In doing so, you yourself fall a victim to its snares.
O Man, wake up. Do not allow your Viveka to become a slave to your love for flesh, for your body. Mercilessly turn down the demands of your body for little comforts. If once you allow it the use of little comforts and you also taste them, it is very difficult for you to assert the superiority of your Viveka over your lower nature.
You cannot divorce your body. Viveka and Vichara are possible only in the human body.
The wife is not merely a mistress to the husband for giving carnal pleasures. She is not a mere creature, but the glory of God's creation that should help you to know Him.
Utilise this body to know and realise God without becoming a slave to it. Otherwise, you are lost. Read the story of 'The Husband and Wife' once again.
