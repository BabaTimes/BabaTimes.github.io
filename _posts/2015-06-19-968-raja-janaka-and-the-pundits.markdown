**Raja Janaka and the Pundits**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Wisdom through Stories - Adhyatma Yoga**](http://www.dlshq.org/books/es29.htm#wisdom) **by** [**Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/siva.htm)

Some Pundits criticised Raja Janaka.  
 "Raja Janaka is a worldly man  
 How can he be a Jnani or a sage?"  
 Raja Janaka wanted to teach them a lesson  
 He called all Pundits  
 And gave them a very good feast  
 Many tasty preparations were served  
 All the Pundits were rejoicing.  
 They saw a sword hanging above their heads  
 The sword was tied by means of a hair.  
 They all trembled  
 They all mixed everything and ate hurriedly.  
 They came to the Durbar  
 Raja Janaka asked  
 "O Pundits, what all things you ate today?"  
 Were they all nice according to your taste?  
 The Pundits replied,  
 "Our minds were on hair only  
 We do not know anything  
 We did not relish anything"  
 Janaka said,  
 "O Pundits! Similar is the state of my mind  
 My mind is fixed on Brahman alone  
 I do not know anything of this world."  
 The Pundits put down their heads in shame  
 They now realised the state of a Jivanmukta.
