**Raja Janaka – by Swami Sivananda**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Inspiring stories**](http://sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&section_id=1194) **by Swami Sivananda**

Raja Janaka once commanded a Brahmin who committed a serious crime to leave his dominion at once. The Brahmin said: "O Rajan, kindly tell me the extent of your dominion. Then I will leave your state and settle down in the dominion of another Rajan". Janaka did not say anything in reply. He sobbed heavily. He reflected seriously. Then he swooned suddenly. He came back to his senses after fifteen minutes. He then said: "I have inherited the state of my father. It is under my control, but nothing belongs to me exclusively. I cannot find my exclusive dominion anywhere, not even in Mithila and in my own progeny. Now real wisdom has dawned in me. I am now under the impression that either I have no dominion at all or all is my dominion. Either this body is not mine or the whole world is mine, and similarly that of others too. O best of the twice-born! This is my firm conviction. Stay in my dominion as long as you like and enjoy."

The Brahmin asked: "O king! What has made you regard this kingdom as not yours or all as yours? How have you renounced the feeling of 'mine-ness' in this kingdom of your ancestors, which you are ruling?" Janaka replied: "Everything is perishable on the physical plane. Life is evanescent. Everything passes away. I could lay my finger on nothing which I could call as mine. I remembered the Vedic text: 'It was anybody's property.' I reflected in this manner and so I have given up the idea of 'mine-ness'. Hearken carefully now as to how I see my dominion everywhere. I have no desire for the objects that give good smell: so I have conquered the earth. I have no desire for tasty things, beautiful forms, soft cushions or beds, or music: therefore I have conquered water, fire, air and ether. I do not desire anything for the mind, it is therefore under my perfect control. I do actions for the Devas, ancestors, for all beings and for those who come to my door."

Then the Brahmin smiled and said: "O king! I am Dharma in disguise. I have come to learn something about you. You are the only person to turn this wheel, the name of which is Brahman, the spoke of which is reason, which never turns back and which is kept to its course by the quality of goodness as its circumference." (Anugita: Ch. 17).
