**Preparing for the Practice of Yoga**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**The Path to God-Realisation Part 1**](http://swami-krishnananda.org/disc/disc_236.html) **by Sri Swami Krishnananda**

_(Spoken on July 12, 1990)_

In our perceptions of the world of persons and things, there is a continuous negation taking place of the indivisibility of the Self. It is so because of the fact that perceptions are based on a divided consciousness. There has to be a division between the subjective side and the objective side, between the perceiver and the perceived, in order that there may be perception at all.

This dichotomy between the location of the seer and the seen is precisely the contradiction of the indivisible nature of the Self. Thus, we may say that we are perpetually negating the existence of the Self in everything that we do and in everything that we see, cognise, or perceive through our sense organs.

The moment the Self is negated, the consequence thereof follows automatically: the character of non-Self inundates us. We become at once other than what we are. The greatest fear is the loss of one’s own Self, and that fear is perpetually on our head like a Damocles Sword – because of the fact that there is a continuous negation of the Self taking place in our perceptions through the sense organs.

It is, therefore, no wonder that we are unhappy throughout our life. We have fears from all sides – _tapa,_ as we call it; _adhyatmika, adhibhautika, adhidaivika tapa_ harass us. We have fear from our own psychophysical constitution: It may fall ill, or it may even die. That is a fear that we have in regard to our own self. We also have fear of the people around us; very little can be said about their behaviour because it is very whimsical, conditioned by changing factors and circumstances of life. And above all, there is fear of nature, whose wish and will are not known to us even a little. From every side there is insecurity, as it were, and, therefore, there is not a moment of peace for anyone in the world.

Perceptions are of two kinds. These categories may be designated as general and abnormal perceptions. If we can see a thing, be conscious of its existence but not be emotionally disturbed about it, we may consider it as general perception. But if any perception disturbs our feelings, this is certainly not a normal perception. It is not normal because we seem to be dualistically involved in the knowledge of the existence of some person or thing in front of us, and not indivisibly involved or, more properly, normally involved. Unless we are free from it, we cannot actually even commence the practice of yoga.

The world perception is not spiritual. It is so because the character of Selfhood cannot be recognised in any object, in spite of the fact that every object has a Self of its own.

In the same way as in every pool of water, multiple though the pools be, the same sun is reflected, the Universal Self is reflected in every individual person as the Self of that particular person or thing. Therefore, everyone has a Self – not _a_ Self, _the_ very Self Itself. Yet, in perceptions, the Self is not recognised. Neither can you see my Self, nor can I see your Self. You see me as a personality seated here, and I also do the same thing in regard to you. If this is the way in which the world goes on, world experience cannot be regarded as spiritual experience. Therefore, we call life in the world as samsara, which means an aberration from the nature of Selfhood; a deviation from truth. We move away from the centre of our personality, away from the root of the Self, to that which is other than Itself.

If there is certainly nothing other than the Self, then what is the meaning of the deviation of consciousness from the Self to the not-Self? The not-Self actually is not a person or a thing. It is the manner in which consciousness adapts itself to persons and things outside. Your judgment of values is what will determine the spirituality or the unspirituality of things. The things in the world are neither spiritual nor unspiritual; they just are, as they ought to be. But the perceptions differ on account of the non-recognition of the Selfhood, or the character of subjectivity in things.

Any kind of abnormality of behaviour, whether psychologically or ethically, will prevent the general perception of things. We cannot see things as they are. We always see things as they are not. The well-known dicta of the principles of _yama – ahimsa, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, aparigraha_ – may be considered as the first principles of ethical and moral practice, which is an endeavour on our part to restrain ourselves in many a manner.

The art of self-restraint, which is practically the whole of yoga, right from the beginning to the end, is constituted of a systematic extrication of consciousness from its connection with the layers of involvement in its perceptions – to repeat, general as well as abnormal.

Thus, the practice of yoga, which is the art of the realisation of God or the Universal Self, is, on the one hand, a direct endeavour to concentrate the mind on a well-conceived ideal which is called _abhyasa_, and simultaneously on the other hand, it is a negation of anything which may intrude into this consciousness of the concentration on the Universal Ideal. With these two phases of our practice, known as _abhyasa_ and _vairagya,_ we should go ahead, driving the chariot of our personality to the abode of God Almighty.
