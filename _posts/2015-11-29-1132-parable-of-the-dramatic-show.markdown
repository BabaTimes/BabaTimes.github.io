**Parable of “The Dramatic Show”**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Parables of Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/download/parables.htm#_VPID_122) **by** [**Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/siva.htm)

**Om Sri Sadguru Paramatmane Namah**

The Principal of St. Joseph's academy organised a dramatic show entitled "Reunion." He announced that different actors would act on the stage for three hours and after the show, he would distribute prizes and cups, for good actors, in the presence of the distinguished gentry of the town. The very name of the drama fascinated me and I went to see it. Actors were given proper costumes and were told to act different roles. When everything was ready, the Principal declared the drama open and the drama commenced. A set of actors came, played their part and then disappeared. Another set of actors came and playing their part, too, disappeared likewise. The process was continuous. See that bad actor! He is not acting his role. He is retarding others in their acting. He is busy in correcting others in their acting. He is busy in correcting his costume, decorating his costume, but not doing his role. He thinks there is no Principal and the drama will never end and that he will continue to enjoy for ever and do as he likes. He is a fool though he thinks he is wise. The Principal and the gentry have spotted him. He is spoiling the whole show. The Principal is very forgiving and so he did not remove him from the stage at once, but waited till his part was over, and then he was punished for his misdeeds and was weeping.

Here comes a good actor. His acting is fine. He had acute back-ache; but he now seems to have entirely forgotten all about that ache of his and is busy acting his role as best as he could, is lost in it. He firmly believes that the show will end after but three hours and then the Principal will adjudge all the actors. His only concern is to play now his role to the best of his powers. He did play his role in a fine manner and now all are praising him for the way he acted. He has won the hearts of all the spectators.

Soon the show was over. All those actors that were selected for awards were escorted with honour to the dais. The Principal and the gentry were visibly pleased with them. They were all called out one after the other and were awarded their allotted prizes, cups and various other honours; and they were in great joy. It was a grand show, this one. While returning home, I was caught in a reverie, going over the whole show of the evening once again mentally and murmuring to myself.

God has organised a similar dramatic show of this world entitled 'God-realisation'. He has announced through prophets and saints that Jivatmas will act for a definite number of years, wearing different bodies. The breaths of all bodies are counted. Then He will judge all and give cups and prizes of eternity to good actors in the presence of saints of divine court. God gave bodies to Jivatmas and assigned different roles to them. When He created the world this world-drama started. A set of bodies come, play their part and then disappear. Another set of actors come and disappear likewise. The process is continuous. See that bad actor. He is not acting his role and is retarding others' in doing Bhakti. He is attached to his body and is ever busy in feeding it and maintaining it and in enjoying worldly pleasures and not doing Bhakti to God. He thinks there is no God; he will never cast off his body, but will continue to enjoy body pleasures for ever as he likes. He is a fool though he thinks he is wise. God and His courtiers are watching him all the time. He is a blot on the world-drama. God is very forgiving and does not punish him at once. He waits till he finishes his part and then He punishes him and he weeps.

Here comes a good person. He lives the divine life. He may have a diseased body, but he has forgotten all about the diseased condition of his body. He is ever busy doing Bhakti to God with all his power. He firmly believes that he must die sometime and that God will judge all. His only worry is to do Bhakti as much as he can. He has won the hearts of all and all praise him now. When he casts away his body, he is escorted to the Court of God with honours. God and His courtiers are pleased to see Bhaktas. God calls them one after the other and awards the prizes and cups of eternity and then they are in great joy and bliss.

Let us become good actors in this world drama. Forget worrying about disease and death. They are sure to come. Adapt to circumstances and keep busy in Bhakti. Food, dress, and worldly actions are necessary, but above all is Bhakti of God, which is the role for which God has given this body. Let us do it even now and deserve God's praises and honours in the Court of the Divine, and enjoy Bliss Infinite.
