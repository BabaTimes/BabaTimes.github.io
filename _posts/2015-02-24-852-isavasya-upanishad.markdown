**Isavasya Upanishad**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Commentary on the Isavasya Upanishad**](http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/disc/disc_186.html) **by Sri Swami Krishnananda**

Verses

Ōm pūrṇam adaḥ, pūrṇam idam, pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate |

pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate ||

That is Full; this is full. From the Full does the Full proceed.

After the coming of the Full from the full, the Full alone remains.

Om īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam yat kiṁ ca jagatyāṁ jagat |

tena tyaktena bhuñjitha, ma gṛdhaḥ kasyasvid dhanam ||1||

OM. All this – whatsoever moves on the earth – should be covered by the Lord. Protect (your Self) through that detachment. Do not covet anybody’s wealth. (or – Do not covet, for whose is wealth?)

kurvann eveha karmāṇi jijīviṣet śataṁ samāḥ |

evaṁ tvayi nānyatheto’sti na karma lipyate nare ||2||

By doing karma indeed should one wish to live here for a hundred years. For a man such as you (who wants to live thus), there is no other way than this, whereby karma may not cling to you.

asuryā nāma te lokā andhena tamasā vṛtāḥ |

tāṁs te pretyābhigacchanti ye ke cātmahano janāḥ ||3||

Those worlds of devils are covered by blinded darkness. Those people that kill the Self go to them after giving up this body.

anejad ekaṁ manaso javīyo nainad devā āpnuvan pūrvamarṣat |

tad dhāvato’nyān-atyeti tiṣṭhat tasminn apo mātariśvā dadhāti ||4||

It is unmoving, one, and faster than the mind. The senses could not overtake It, since It ran ahead. Remaining stationary, It outruns all other runners. It being there, Matarisva allots (or supports) all activities.

tad ejati tan naijati tad dūre tad vad antike |

tad antarasya sarvasya tad u sarvasyāsya bāhyataḥ ||5||

That moves, That does not move; That is far off, That is very near; That is inside all, and That is outside all.

yas tu sarvāṇi bhūtani ātmany evānupaśyati |

sarvabhūteṣu catmānaṁ tato na vijugupsate ||6||

He who sees all beings in the very Self, and the Self in all beings, feels no hatred by that (realisation).

yasmin sarvāṇi bhūtāny ātmaivābhūd vijānataḥ |

tatra ko mohaḥ kaḥ śokaḥ ekatvam anupaśyataḥ ||7||

When to the man of realisation all beings become the very Self, then what delusion and what sorrow can there be for that seer of oneness?

sa paryagāc chukram, akāyam, avraṇam, asnāviram, śuddham, apāpaviddham |

kavir manīṣī, paribhūḥ, svayambhūḥ, yāthātathyato’rthān vyadadhāc chāśvatībhyas samābhyaḥ ||8||

He is all-pervasive, pure, bodyless, without wound, without sinews, taintless, untouched by sin, omniscient, ruler of mind, transcendent, and self-existent; he has duly allotted the (respective) duties to the eternal years (i.e., to the eternal creators called by that name).

andhaṁ tamaḥ praviśanti yo’vidyām upasate |

tato bhūya iva te tamo ya u vidyāyāṁ ratāḥ ||9||

Those who worship _avidya_, enter into blinded darkness; but into greater darkness than that, enter they who are engaged in _vidya_.

anyad evāhur vidyayā anyad āhur avidyayā |

iti śuśruma dhīrāṇām ye nas tad vicacakṣire ||10||

“They say that by _vidya_ a really different result is achieved, and by _avidya_ a different result.” Thus have we heard (the teaching of) those wise men who explained that to us.

vidyāṁ cāvidyāṁ ca yas tad vedobhayam saha |

avidyayā mṛtyuṁ tīrtvā vidyayāmṛtam aśnute ||11||

He who knows these two – _vidya_ and _avidya_ – together, attains immortality through _vidya_, by crossing over death through _avidya_.

andhaṁ tamaḥ praviśanti ye’sambhūtim upāsate |

tato bhuya iva te tamo ya u sambhutyāṁ ratāḥ ||12||

Those who worship the Unmanifested, enter into blinding darkness; but those who are devoted to the Manifest, enter into greater darkness.

anyad evahūḥ sambhavād anyad āhur asambhavāt |

iti śuśruma dhīrāṇām ye nas tad vicacakṣire ||13||

“They spoke of different results from the worship of the Manifested, and they spoke of different results from the worship of the Unmanifested” – thus we have heard (the teaching of those wise men.)

sambhūtiṁ ca vināśaṁ ca yas tad vedobhayaṁ saha |

vināśena mṛtyuṁ tīrtvā sambhūtyā amṛtam aśnute ||14||

He who knows these two – the Unmanifested and Destruction – together, attains immortality through the Unmanifested by crossing death through Destruction.

hiraṇmayena pātreṇa satyasyāpihitam mukham |

tat tvaṁ pūṣan āpāvṛṇu satyadharmāya dṛṣṭaye ||15||

The face of the Truth (Brahman in the solar orb) is concealed with a golden vessel. Do thou, O Sun, open it so as to be seen by me, who am by nature truthful (or, who am the performer of rightful duties).

pūṣann ekarṣe yama sūrya prājāpatya vyūha raśmīn samūha tejaḥ |

yat te rūpaṁ kalyāṇatamaṁ tat te paśyāmi yo sāv asau puruṣaḥ, so’ham asmi ||16||

O Thou, who art the nourisher, the solitary traveller, the controller, the acquirer, the son of Prajapati, do remove Thy rays, do gather up thy dazzle. I shall behold that form of Thine, which is the most benign. I am that very person that is yonder (in the sun).

vāyur anilam amṛtam athedam bhasmāntaṁ śarīram |

aum krato smara kṛtaṁ smara krato smara kṛtaṁ smara ||17||

Let my vital force now attain the (all-pervading) immortal air; and now let this body be reduced to ashes. OM, O my mind remember – remember all that has been done. Remember – remember all that has been done.

agne naya supathā rāye asmān viśvāni deva vayunāni vidvān |  
 yuyodhyasmaj juharāṇam eno bhūyiṣṭhāṁ te nama-uktim vidhema ||18||

O Fire! O God! Knowing as Thou doest all our deeds, lead us by the good path for the enjoyment of the fruits of our deeds; remove us from all crooked sins. We offer Thee many words of Salutation!

Ōm śāntih śāntih śāntih!  
 Om. May there be peace, peace, peace!
