**Philosophy and Teachings of Sivananda**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Essays in Philosophy**](http://www.dlshq.org/books/es42.htm#philo) **by Sri Swami Satchidananda**
There is an innate urge in everyone to attain Immortality, higher Knowledge and eternal Bliss. This gives the clue that Brahman exists.
In dream you are distinct from the physical body. In deep sleep you are distinct from the body and mind; and yet you enjoy peace independent of objects. This gives the clue that you are in essence Atma or the Imperishable, Immortal Self.
The Supreme Reality is Self-luminous, Self-contained. It is Sat-Chit-Ananda. It is all-full. It is Perfect. By realising this Brahman alone you can attain Liberation.
The impure mind is the cause of bondage and the pure mind is the cause of liberation. It is the mind that creates the world. There is no world in deep sleep when there is no mind.
Sorrow has the body as its cause. The body has Karma for its cause. Karma proceeds from the notion of "I". The idea of "I" has ignorance for its cause. The erroneous notion that "I am the body" is called Avidya or ignorance. It binds the man. "I am not this body, but blissful, all-pervading Atman"—this is called Knowledge. This will liberate you.
A life of right conduct is a necessary factor in the enquiry into and discovery of Atman or Brahman, the source and basis for this world, body and mind.
Righteousness forms the bedrock of all religions. Righteousness is the divine path. Dharma is the perfect pattern of life.
Serve, love, sing, give, purify, meditate, realise. Be good. Do good. Be kind. Be compassionate. Be honest. Be sincere. Be truthful. Be bold. Be pure. Be virtuous. Develop the Four Means. Enquire "Who am I?" Know the Self and be free. This is the essence of Sadhana.
Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Raja Yoga are the means to Jnana. Karma removes the impurities of the mind. Bhakti Yoga removes the oscillation of the mind and softens the heart. Raja Yoga steadies the mind. Karma, Bhakti, Yoga and Jnana do not mutually exclude each other. Bhakti is not divorced from Jnana; on the contrary Jnana intensifies Bhakti. Para Bhakti and Jnana are one.
Moksha or Liberation is not a thing to be attained. It is already there. You will have to know that you are identical with the Supreme Reality through intuition.
Samadhi is an experience in which the aspirant feels his oneness with Brahman or the Supreme Reality. Samadhi is intense awareness of the Reality. It is the Highest intuition. It is an experience of fullness. It transcends duality of all kinds. He who has experienced Samadhi becomes wise and illumined.
May you be established in Samadhi through discrimination, dispassion, serenity, intense yearning for liberation and the Grace of the Lord!
