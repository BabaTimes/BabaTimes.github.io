Vastu shastra (_vāstu śāstra_, also vastu veda and _vastuvidya_, "science of construction", "architecture") is an ancient doctrine which consists of precepts born out of a traditional view on how the laws of nature affect human dwellings. The designs are based on directional alignments. It is primarily applied in Hindu architecture, especially for Hindu temples, although it covers other domains, including vehicles, vessels, furniture, sculpture, etc. The foundation of Vastu is traditionally ascribed to the mythical sage Mamuni Mayan (Mahaa-muni Maya, a daanava/demon reformed by tapasyaa/austerities) in South and Vishvakarman in North India.
