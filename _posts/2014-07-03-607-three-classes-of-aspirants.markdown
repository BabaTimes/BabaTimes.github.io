 **Three Classes of Aspirants**



**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Raja Yoga**](http://www.dlshq.org/teachings/rajayoga.htm#aspirants) **by Sri Swami Sivananda**

Raja Yoga is the king of Yogas. It concerns directly with the mind. In this Yoga there is no struggling with Prana or physical body. There are no Hatha Yogic Kriyas. The Yogi seats at ease, watches his mind and silences the bubbling thoughts. He stills the mind, restraints the thought-waves and enters into the thoughtless state or Asamprajnata Samadhi, Hence the name Raja Yoga. Though Raja Yoga is a dualistic philosophy and treats of Prakriti and Purusha, it helps the student in Advaitic Realization of oneness eventually. Though there is the mention of Purusha, ultimately the Purusha becomes identical with Highest Self or Purusha, or Brahman of Upanishads. Raja Yoga pushes the student to the highest rung of the spiritual ladder of Advaitic realization of Brahman.

Raja Yoga is the royal road to freedom from misery. It treats of the four great principles: misery, its cause, freedom from misery and the means. The practice of the methods prescribed in Raja Yoga leads to the cessation of all miseries and attainment of eternal bliss. Practice from today. Never miss a day. Remember each day brings you nearer to the end of earthly existence as human being. You have wasted many days, many months and many years. You do not realize it because you have drunk the liquor of Moha. Therefore, you do not understand the real cause of the miseries of this earthly life.

The cause of this misery is _Avidya_. When the sun of discrimination arises within, the Purusha realizes that He is distinct from Prakriti, that He is independent and unaffected. Raja Yoga gives you a most practical method of bringing about this exalted state.

According to Raja Yoga, there are three types of aspirants - _Uttama, Madhyama_ and _Adhama Adhikaris_. To three classes of aspirants Raja Yoga prescribes three kinds of Sadhana.

To the Uttama Adhikari (first-class aspirant) Raja Yoga prescribes Abhyasa and Vairagya. He practices meditation on the Self; he practices Chitta-Vritti-Nirodha (restraining the modification of the mind-stuff) and soon enters into Samadhi. This is practice (Abhyasa) sustained by Vairagya.

To the Madhyama Adhikari (middling aspirant) Raja Yoga prescribes the _Kriya Yoga - Tapas, Svadhyaya_ and _Ishvarapranidhana_. Tapas is austerity. Egolessness and selfless service are the greatest forms of Tapas. Humility and desirelessness are the greatest forms of austerity. Practice these through ceaseless, untiring, selfless service. Practice the three kinds of Tapas mentioned in the [Gita](http://www.dlshq.org/download/gita_busy.htm). Disciplinary practices like fasting, etc., also come under Tapas. Svadhyaya is study of spiritual literature and also Japa of your Ishta [Mantra](http://www.dlshq.org/glossary.htm#mantra). Ishvarapranidhana is self-surrender to the Lord and doing all actions as Ishvararpana, as offering unto the Lord. These three form the Sadhanas of the Madhyama Adhikari who enters into deep meditation very soon and attains Kaivalya Moksha.

To the Adhama Adhikari, lowest kind of aspirant, Raja Yoga prescribes [Ashtanga Yoga](http://www.dlshq.org/teachings/rajayoga.htm#ashtanga) or the eightfold Sadhana - _Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana_ and _Samadhi_.
