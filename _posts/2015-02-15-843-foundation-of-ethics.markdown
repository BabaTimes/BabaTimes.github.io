**Foundation of Ethics**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Ethical Teachings**](http://www.dlshq.org/books/es48.htm#foundation) **by** [**Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/siva.htm)

Ahimsa, Satyam, Brahmacharya are the very foundation of ethics, Yoga and Vedanta. Practice of these three virtues is a Maha Vrata or great universal vow, for the whole mankind. These are Samanya or Sadachara Dharma (common duty) of men. The practice of these cardinal virtues purifies the heart and steadies the mind, and prepares the Antahkarana for the reception of the transcendental light. Dharma is rooted in these virtues. All enmities and hatred cease in the presence of one who is established in Ahimsa. Brahman or the Eternal is Truth itself. It can be realised only by practising Purity.

The practice of endurance (Titiksha) steadfastness (Dhairya), control of senses (Indriya-Nigraha) and other Sadachara Karmas (virtuous deeds) aim in making a man self-sufficient, independent and free from external bondage, physical and social.

Ahimsa or refraining from injury is a self-evident duty of every man. It is not simply in the negative sense of mere cessation from harm or injury (Himsa-abhava). It is a positive definite resolve or internal Sankalpa or the attitude of the will not to hurt any living creature. You should practise Ahimsa in thought, word and deed. No thought of revenge or ill-will should arise in the mind.

Injuring others gives rise to hatred and enmity. From these arise violence and revenge. Fear also comes to reign. Where fear and violence reign, there is destroyed peace and society will be in chaos. This is the real condition of modern society today. It is in a state of dormant or suppressed chaos only. There is just a semblance of order outside. Violence, disorder and hatred of one sort is kept suppressed by force, violence and hatred of another kind. Society is filled with crime, open and concealed in spite of police forces visible and secret. All this constant fear, tension and tug-of-war between man and man would vanish if Ahimsa comes to be practised by one and all.

Brahmacharya also is not the mere abstaining from the outward act of sexual indulgence, but also implies a definite resolve or internal Sankalpa or the attitude of the will not to long for sexual indulgence even in thought. You must observe Brahmacharya in thought, word and deed.

Asteya is not mere refraining from theft. It is not mere cessation from appropriating what belongs to another but implies an internal Sankalpa or resolve not to think of misappropriation of any object belonging to others and to disapprove and scorn all acts of misappropriation as unrighteous.

The inner motives of a man form the seed and root of all his life’s activities. If it is pure all the subsequent consequences are pure and good. Else only evil and unhappiness will accrue. A man of purity becomes a positive elevating influence, affecting all beneficially; whereas a man of impurity vitiates everything he contacts. Therefore it is a moral obligation of the individual to society to keep purity of character and be a force for good in society. Else he harms them.

You must have Bhava-Suddhi or purification of the motive. Acts done with pure motive only will be conducive to morality. There must be an internal Sankalpa or resolve or attitude of the will to be free from all impure feelings of pride, self-esteem, etc., in the discharge of duties. Only then you will have purity of motive.
