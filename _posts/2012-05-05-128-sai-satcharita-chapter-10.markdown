Sai Satcharita Chapter 10

* * *

None knows the exact birth-date of Sai Baba or how He came to be in Shirdi, but it could be approximated by His stay in Shirdi. Since Baba was sixteen when He first came to Shirdi, and twenty when He reappeared in the village to stay forever, it can be assumed that Baba was born in 1838. He was approximately 80 years old when He ascended to the celestial plane. Throughout His time on Earth, Shirdi Baba always preached one message to his devotees. He said that all Gods were one, and that there was no difference between religions because they all believed in God and a Supreme Being. Baba used to read scriptures from all the religions, and pray to both Allah and the Hindu Gods. He saw Divinity in all people, animals, and beings. One such story is described in the tale of Nanavalli.



Nanavalli was a quiet man who lived in Shirdi, and worked for Baba at his Masjid. One day, he came to Baba and had a strange request that Baba get off His seat as he wanted to sit on it. Baba was not angry at all, and got up from His seat to let Nanavalli sit in it. Nanavalli sat in Baba’s feet and then fell at Baba’s feet. He passed away that day after serving Baba his whole life.
