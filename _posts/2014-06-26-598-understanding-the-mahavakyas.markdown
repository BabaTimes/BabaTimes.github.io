 **Who is a brahmin?**
Brahmin is one who believes in the Vedas and follows its tenets.
 **What do the Vedas reveal?**
Vedas reveal the attributes of brahman and how to attain it.
 **W**** hat is brahman(m)?**
Pragnanam Brahma! The highest form of knowledge is brahmam.
When I want to know of brahmam, you are introducing another concept Knowledge?
Well, the easiest way to identify brahman is "Aham Brahmasmi". I am brahman!
But you are my Guru and you have a name which is not brahmam.
It is not that I am alone brahmam.
"Tat Tvam Asi". You are also that brahmam!!.
Now is it clear?
How can it be clear?
When I ask about brahmam, you have simplified it by saying that you are brahmam and so am I.
Oh! what I actually meant is that the ATMAN in each one of us is the brahmam
"Ayam Atma Brahman"!!
