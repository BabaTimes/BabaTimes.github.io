**A King and the Court Pundit**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Wisdom through Stories - Adhyatma Yoga**](http://www.dlshq.org/books/es29.htm#wisdom) **by** [**Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/siva.htm)
A king said to his Court Pundit  
 "Bring a man who is blissful here and there also.  
 Bring another man who is miserable here and there also.  
 Bring a third man who is happy here and miserable there  
 Bring a fourth man who is miserable here and happy there."  
 The Pundit was in a great dilemma,  
 His intelligent daughter helped him  
 "Take this sage before the king  
 He is happy here and there also.  
 Take this beggar before him  
 He is miserable here and miserable after his death also.  
 Take this wicked rich man before him  
 He is happy here but miserable in hell after his death.  
 Take this ascetic before him  
 Who has emaciated his body.  
 He is miserable here but happy there in heaven"  
 The Pundit gained strength now  
 He took the four people before the king  
 The king was quite satisfied now.
