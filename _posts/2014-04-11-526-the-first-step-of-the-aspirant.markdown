**The First Step of the Aspirant**

**Divine Life Society Publication: -** [**The Realisation of The Absolute**](http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/realis/realis_8.html) **by Sri Swami Krishnananda**

Vedanta is the Science of Reality. Reality is uncontradicted experience, the experience that is not transcended or sublated by any other experience. Naturally, Reality must be imperish-able, for perishability marks a state or a thing as unreal. Imperishability means, at the same time, unlimitedness, for limit is non-independence and non-absoluteness, which means changefulness. Changelessness is the nature of Truth. The world which we live in is characterized by change and destruction. The world includes the individual, also. The body of an individual is a part of the world as a whole. The changing character of the world is kept up by changing events, changing actions, changing thoughts and feelings. Hence, the quest for Reality must necessarily be of a nature quite different from the natural ways of the world. The seeker after the Real has to be specially equipped with the power of separating Truth from falsehood; Reality from the unreal, transient universe.

The change required of an aspirant after the Real is not an ordinary external one, but a total transfiguration of life itself. This extraordinary change in life is hard to be had; the seeker after Perfection is asked to get himself ready for this great change for good.

The immediate reality which presents itself before us is the physical body situated in the physical world. Hence the first discipline required is of bodily actions or _karma_. _Karma_ has a special significance in religion and philosophy. In addition to service devoid of individualistic motive or desire, _karma_ means the selfless performance of one’s own prescribed duty without reluctance or failure. Every person is expected to be either a _brahmachari_, a _grihastha_, a _vanaprastha_ or a _sannyasi_. One should not live, as far as it is within one’s capacity, in a stage which is not one of these four. And also, a person can belong to only one _ashrama_ at a time, not to more than one. Performance of one’s own duty means the observance of the _ashrama-dharma_. _Nitya_ and _naimittika_ _karmas_ pertaining to an _ashrama_ constitute _svadharma_ or one’s own duty, as far as the _Vedanta_ philosophy is concerned with it. _Kamya-karmas_ are excluded from _svadharma_.

The rigid observance of _svadharma_ renders the mind pure (_shuddha_), freeing it from _mala_, the gross _tamas_ and _rajas_ which are the deluding and the distracting factors in it. The _Vedanta_ prescribes _upasana_ or the worship of and meditation on the personal God (_Saguna Brahman_) to those who have thus already purified their nature or attained _chitta-shuddhi_ through _nishkama-karma_. _Upasana_ removes _vikshepa_ and brings _chitta-ekagrata_ or one-pointedness of mind. It is this prepared aspirant who is qualified with _shuddhi_ and _ekagrata_ of _chitta_ that is required to possess the _sadhana-chatushtaya_, the ethical requisites which are directly connected with the entrance to the main court of _Vedanta-sadhana_.

_Sadhana-chatushtaya_ means the fourfold equipment, the necessary means to _brahma-vidya_, which removes _avarana_ or the veil of ignorance. The discussion about the _adhikari_ is one of the main subjects in the _Vedanta_. The first of these _sadhanas_ is _viveka_ or clear discrimination between the Eternal Principle and the perishable universe of names and forms. _Viveka_ generally comes through _purva-punya_ or the effect of past meritorious deeds accelerated by the perception of pain and death here. _Satsanga_ is another factor which generates _viveka_. Perhaps _satsanga_ is the greatest of all the means that transforms a person from worldliness to divine life. _Satsanga_ leads to _viveka_ and _vichara_, consciousness of the inadequacy of the phenomenal world and enquiry into the nature of Truth.

_Viveka_ creates an indifference to the world and its contents. This supreme indifference born of _viveka_ is the second of the four means, _vairagya_. True _vairagya_ is the effect of correct discrimination and not of mere failure in life. Real dispassion is the consequence of the perception of the impermanence of things, the falsity of the existence of happiness in objects, the knowledge of the distinction between Reality and appearance. This _vairagya_ reaches even up to _Brahmaloka_, the highest phenomenal manifestation, and discards it as defective. Thus, _vairagya_ is distaste for everything that is objective (including one’s own body). It is not possible to love the Eternal as long as there is faith in the impermanent. Immortality and mortality are set against each other. Passion for the world and its objects is opposed to devotion to the Supreme Being, even as darkness is against light. Where the latter is, the former is not. _Vairagya_ is the gateway to the knowledge of what truly is.

The third of the requisites is _shatsampat_ or the sixfold wealth of internal discipline and virtues. (1) Tranquillity of mind (_shama_) which is the result of _viveka_ and _vairagya_, (2) Self-restraint (_dama_) or control of the senses which is the effect of the knowledge of the ultimate worthlessness of the forms of external objects, (3) Cessation from distracting activity connected with the world (_uparati_), (4) Fortitude (_titiksha_) or the power to endure the ravages of Nature, like heat and cold, hunger and thirst, censure and praise, insult and injury, etc., (5) Faith (_shraddha_) in God, Preceptor, Scripture and the Voice of one’s own purified Conscience, and (6) One-pointedness of mind (_samadhana_), i.e., resting of the mind in the spiritual Ideal alone to the exclusion of everything else, are the six spiritual qualities which together make up the _shatsampat_. All these virtues are to be developed on the basis of correct understanding or clarified intelligence and not by mere force. The greater and more purified the understanding, the more precious and diviner is the virtue.

The last of the four means is _mumukshutva_ or an ardent yearning for freeing oneself from the ignorance of finite life. These are the important conditions that are to be fulfilled by every aspirant after the Absolute Truth, before he actually starts _sadhana_ in its strict sense. It is to be, however, pointed out again, that none of these _sadhanas_ is to be practiced with brute force without proper purification and a brilliant discrimination.
