**God The Almighty**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Invoking Succor from God the Almighty**](http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/disc/disc_230.html) **by Swami Krishnananda**
Spoken on August 18,1985
The soul’s anguish for God will be the answer to the question as to what we are to expect in our spiritual adventure. There is the well-known path of _krama-mukti_, the gradual progressive salvation described in detail in the Upanishads. But there is also what is called _sadyo-mukti_. This is the action of God at once. He has no protocol, and there is no action through the proper channel. He breaks through all this intricate winding processes and grasps the spirit of the devotee with His own hands. Stories like the incident of Gajendra’s moksha are illustrations on this point. Why should Narayana himself come? Has he not got anybody else? He could have sent some assistant, some Garuda, to go and help this poor elephant. He has got so many, but he ran himself.
It appears Akbar was told this story by Birbal, that Narayana ran, unaware of anything else. “What kind of God you have got? Foolish God,” said Akbar. “Why should he run for a little thing? He is almighty; he has got such strength. He could have told some of his attendants to go and help, and they are equally capable. It was not such a serious matter.”
“Well, I will answer this question.” Birbal took time to answer the question how this is possible.
It appears that Birbal was the caretaker of the very, very beloved child, the son of Akbar. He was always taking care of him, taking him for a walk, and so on. One day Birbal asked a sculptor to prepare a beautiful image identical in features with this boy, and he placed this image on the edge of a deep well and left it there. Akbar knew very well that the boy was always under the protection of Birbal and was caring for him. One day, Birbal took Akbar for a walk near this well when it was dusk and things could not be seen properly. “Oh, my boy is here near the well,” Akbar said. “How is he near the well?”
“It’s all right, it’s all right,” Birbal said.
Birbal had already arranged with someone that at the time when Akbar was to be there, this image was to be pushed into the well, and it was pushed. Birbal said, “O God, the child is in the well!” Akbar ran immediately. “Wait, wait, wait, wait!” Birbal said, “Wait here. You have got so many attendants. Send your attendants.”
“Oh, don’t talk, foolish idiot! My child is in the water. I will go and take him myself.”
“Your Highness, your child is safe. Don’t be afraid. Here is the child,” he said. “It is only an image, but I have answered your question.”

Narayana is not an idiotic god. The love of God for the soul that seeks Him is not explicable by human language, and it is not to be interpreted even by a scripture. The Srimad Bhagavata tells us that scriptures, the Vedas themselves are incapable of putting into form and shape the might and majesty and glory of the internal relation that God maintains with His devotee: aham bhakta paradhinaha, says Narayana (S.B. 9.4.36). This is a statement which God can make and man cannot understand: I am dependent on my devotee. Why should He be dependent on the _bhakta?_ This is capable of being understood as a metaphorical statement of the perpetual care that God takes of the soul that is in union with Him.
