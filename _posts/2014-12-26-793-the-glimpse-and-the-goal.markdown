**The Glimpse and The Goal**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Inspiration**](http://www.sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&section_id=422&parent=355&format=html) **by Sri Swami Sivananda**

When you get a flash of illumination, do not be frightened. It will be a new experience of immense joy. Do not turn back. Do not give up meditation. Do not stop there. You will have to advance still further. This is only a glimpse of truth. This is not the whole experience. This is not the highest realisation. This is only a new platform. Try to ascend further. Reach the bhuma (the infinite). Now alone you are proof against all temptation. You will drink deep the nectar of immortality. This is the acme or final state. You can take eternal rest now. You need not meditate any further. This is the final goal.

You have within yourself tremendous powers and latent faculties of which you have really never had any conception. You must awaken these dormant powers and faculties by the practice of meditation and yoga. You must develop your will and control your senses and mind. You must purify yourself and practise regular meditation, only then, can you become a superman or God man.

Every human being has within himself various potentialities and capacities. He is a magazine of power and knowledge. As he evolves he unfolds new powers, new faculties, new qualities. Now he can change his environment and influence others. He can subdue others' minds. He can conquer internal and external nature. He can enter into superconscious state.

The wise cut asunder the knot of egoism by the sharp sword of constant meditation. Then dawns the supreme knowledge of the self or full illumination or self-realisation. The liberated sage has neither doubt nor delusion. All bonds of karma (action) are rent asunder. This is the master-key to open the realms of eternal bliss. It may be tiring in the beginning, because the mind will be running away from the point (laksya) every now and then. But after some time it will be focused in the centre. You will be immersed in divine bliss.
