**Yuga**  **in Hindu philosophy**

* * *  






It is the name of an 'epoch' or 'era' within a cycle of four ages. These are the Satya Yuga, the Treta Yuga, the Dvapara Yuga, and finally the Kali Yuga. According to Hindu cosmology, life in the universe is created, destroyed once every 4.1 to 8.2 billion years,
## **Kalki**

Lord Vishnu has many avatars and in each yuga,he has revealed all of them except-the last avatar(tenth)-Kalki.It is said that in the last yuga Lord Vishnu will reveal this avatar too and the Kalki avatar will lead to the end of the world.The main reason is to destroy the wicked,to restart the new creation,and to restore the purity of conduct in people's life. This avatar will be seated in a white horse with a drawn sword blazing like a comet.

## **Durations of four yugas**

According to the Laws of Manu, one of the earliest known texts describing the yugas, the length is 4800 years + 3600 years + 2400 years + 1200 years for a total of 12,000 years for one arc, or 24,000 years to complete the cycle (one precession of the equinox). There is no mention of a year of the demigods or any year longer than the solar year, which is consistent with description in The Holy Science.
