 **Baba's morning routine**

* * *

[A semi-fictious article]

Shirdi: Maharashtra, India: (One of the Hot Summer Days in 1912 AD, from early morning to about noon)

It was Chavadi day for Baba last night, he slept in the Chavadi. The previous day was at Dwarakamai. Baba woke up in the morning and as usual was sitting on the stone in one of the corners of the Chavadi, which is basically a single room.

Baba thought “Where is Megha? What is holding him up?”

Megha always comes early morning to either Chavadi or Dwarakamai before Baba wakes up, to do the Kakad Arati. The other devotees have already started gathering to attend the Kakad Arati. Megha just arrived in and started the preparations for the Arati. After Megha finished the Arati, prasadam was distributed and the devotees went about their work. Some went to sing Bajans, others meditation.

After the Arati, Baba stood up and prepared to go to Dwarakamai as he will sleep there tonight. It is a short distance between the Chavadi and Dwarakamai. Baba will sleep alternatively between these two places for the rest of his life. When Baba arrived in the Dwarakamai,

Bhagoji Sinde was waiting there.

Bhagoji Sinde “Sainath Maharajki Jai !”

Baba “Alla Maalik Ek”

Bhagoji picked up the ghee he brought, applied on Baba’s hand and put the leaf over to make a bandage. Baba does not like this, but Bhagoji insists that the wound has to be cured soon. But Bahgoji could not keep quiet.

He asked “Baba, what happened, how did you get this burn?”

Baba “I had to save the child of one of my devotees who was about to fall in the fire. I put my hand in the fire here to save the child there”. Bhagoji had to do this daily to heal the wound for Baba.

Baba saw Radhakrishnamai and Abdul Baba whom Baba used to call ‘the crow’ preparing to sweep the roads from the Masjid (Dwarakamai) all the way to Lendi Baug. Baba believed in keeping the surrounding very clean.

Abdul Baba had just finished daily duty of cleaning up the five lamps and he will return tonight again to fill them up with oil.

Then Bhagoji thought it was time for the Chillum and he lighted one and gave to Baba. Bhagoji saw how Baba enjoyed his puffs from the Chillum. The Gadi is Baba’s favorite sit out spot when he wants to enjoy the Chillum.

After the few puffs, he got up and washed his hands, mouth and feet. He has to walk to the Lendi Baug next as a routine. There were unusually more devotees today, gathered in Dwarakamai waiting for Baba to come out.

One of the devotees cried, “Where is the Embrioded Umbrella? Can someone bring it here?”

When Baba came out at about 9.30 AM, the Umbrella is carried over his head as he walked along with all the devotees. They are shouting Jayakar with devotion and joy. They have to cross the Sathe and Dixit Wada before reaching the Lendi. We could see lot of people gathered around Sathe and Dixit Wada too, watching the procession and offering their Namaskars.

As they approached the Lendi, Baba was looking for Abdul, who rushed from behind to accompany Baba inside the Lendi garden, only he was allowed to accompany Baba inside the Garden. It was his duty to take care of the constantly burning lamp lit by Sai Baba many years ago. He also thought he must replace the wood and the metal pieces very soon which were coming off. After Baba and he came in, Abdul went to fill up the pots with water and kept for Baba. Abdul waited for Baba to go around and site behind the Lendi Pillar and not in front of the Lamp. Then Baba took the water from the pot and sprayed in all directions.

Just then Kakasaheb Dixit arrived in the Lendi and opened up his books on Ramayan and other spiritual studies. He started chanting the Parayan of Ramayana which actually Sai Baba directed him to do so long back. He had been doing this daily regularly. The devotees gathered around him and enjoyed his chanting.

It is time now for Baba to leave Lendi and go on rounds in the Village for begging. He chooses only four houses and will be coming back soon to Dwarakamai in a couple of hours. His favorite spot near the wooden railing is waiting for him in the Dwarakamai. By that time Mahalsapathy has finished his Pooja routines in the Kandoba Temple which is about half a mile from Dwarakamai and arrived in the Masjid waiting for Baba.

Baba saw the Vibuthi in his hands, “Oh Mahalsapathy, you want to do it again?”

Mahalsapathy replied “Sainath, as long as I am alive”

Only Mahalsapathy is allowed to put Vibuthi on Baba’s forehead and he actually carries out the Pooja as Baba being the ultimate God. Baba noticed the other devotees coming in a line to do their way of Pooja to him. Although he did not like this practice, he allowed this to please his devotees. Megha comes in a style with Bela leaves to do his own way of Pooja on Baba.

It is about noon now and time for Madhayana Arati. Megha is the one who is going to do this. There is something unique about it. Megha does Madhayana Arati standing on one leg!

Once the Arati is completed, Baba will distribute the fruits and Prasad to all, children get the best of the eatables. Baba stands on the edge of the platform behind the railings, he would send off the devotees after giving the Udi.
