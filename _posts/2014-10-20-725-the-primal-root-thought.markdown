**The Primal Root Thought**
**Divine Life Society Publication: The** [**Mysterious Mind and Its Control**](http://www.dlshq.org/messages/mind.htm#primal) **by Sri Swami Chidananda**
Why does the mind not abide in the center ? What causes it to emerge again into external consciousness ? The first answer is that by its very nature the mind tends to be externalized. Secondly, it is prevented from abiding in its center by the irresistible momentum of the primal root thought "I". This root thought "I" forms the very basis of your limited, false separatist individual personality and it is this root thought which mysteriously induces you into the error of identifying yourself with the body, the senses, the mind and its moods, and with names and forms.
What is the nature of this root form that the mind takes ? It is a universal common denominator and is the basic nature of all normal individuality. It is a root common to the mind of everyone upon the surface of the earth. Its form appears in all languages. In the spiritual sense, it is the arch-enemy of inner evolution. All the vagaries of the mind springs from it. It is the thought "I" and it is the first thought that comes into your mind upon waking. This "I" thought then brings to you the whole universe . Time and space, which is the very stuff of this universe, emerges out of this "I" thought. After all this, your identity mysteriously comes. You know who you are - your name, your age, your false, limited personality. This is the pernicious work of the mind. The basic pillar, the "I" thought, of your psychological personality arises first and the entire structure of the finite individual being is then propped up on it.
Out of this structure comes the thought "mine". Whether you like it or not, from "I" and "mine", the basic selfishness then arises. This is not to be interpreted in the moral or theological sense. This "selfishness" is the natural outcome of the mind function and is the basic nature of all normal individuality. Everyone wants something for oneself. You may say, "I am unselfish", but the deep fact is that you act unselfishly because that means something to _you_. It brings something to you which you like and which is pleasing to you. As in everything that the human being does, there is a deep inner motive even behind "unselfishness". In this motive, in this selfishness, lies the center of the personality, the center of life. Thus , the subtle basis of man's being is selfishness.
In action, the ever-revolving wheel of the mind has in its two spokes, as it were. These two spokes are attraction and repulsion, like and dislike. What is it that man likes ? He likes those things that are pleasant, comfortable and convenient. He dislikes those things that are painful, uncomfortable and unpleasant. The hub of this wheel is the ego.
As this revolving wheel flashes upon the ego, as the reflections of likable and unlikable things are perceived through the senses, desires are engendered in the mind: desires to contact and obtain things which are pleasant and likable and desires to escape and avoid those things which are unpleasant and not likable. When you analyze the life of any human being, you find two categories of activity making up the entire business of living, since all activity is either that occurring while one strives to obtain what one likes, or that occurring while one struggles to avoid what one does not like. Annoyance or anger is felt when such an attempt is being made and the attempt is thwarted or obstructed by someone or something. Intense restlessness and agitation manifest when a desire is felt, but is not fulfilled. Then, when a desire is felt and fulfillment turns out to be something other than the original concept one had of it - what then ? Disappointment is experienced; painful disillusionment comes. Even when the desire is fully fulfilled, as expected, there commences anxiety in the mind - anxiety to preserve the thing or the experience thus obtained, anxiety that it may soon end, as end it must and does, for all things are finite and therefore soon change, perish and pass. What is still worse, if in one's feverish quest of an object one sees others already in possession of it and 'enjoying' it, then jealousy, hatred and envy torment and destroy the peace of mind.
All of these attitudes come out of the prime thought "I" and its chief successor "mine", They all succeed one another at such an incredible speed that the whole of man's life is constantly filled with the internal clatter and clamor of ever-flitting, altering moods, thoughts, and sentiments of this mysterious thing known as the mind. "I" and "mine", like and dislike, desire, restlessness, and then anger, disappointment, selfish elation, attachment, jealousy and hatred ever afflict the mind and keep it in a ferment. This is the common course that the mind follows. Why? Because the mind has lost itself in attending to things _outside_ of itself. Having gone out, by its very nature, it becomes attached and bound up with outside things and thus involves itself in endless external activity. Terrible attachment and bondage is the fate of the non-discriminating mind and the unenlightened reason of the common man.
What happens then is very significant. The moment an experience is obtained by the mind going through the senses towards a desired object, a most significant thing happens, indeed. It is that the mind immediately registers the experience thus obtained by its sense-contact with external object. A subtle inner impression is made upon the mind. This impression is well-nigh indelible.
