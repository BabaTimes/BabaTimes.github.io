## _Welcome to Baba Times: a Window to the world of Philosophy, Religion and Spirituality !_

This website is devoted to Philosophy, Religion, Spirituality and Science. We bring in articles on teachings by Great Saints like Sri Shirdi Sai Baba, Adi Shankara, Swami Sivananda, Swami Krishnananda, Aurobindo, Mother of Auroville and others.

We are in the process of creating a section for donations, where you will be able to show your support for us, and a store dedicated to items for Puja Vidhaan. 

Thank you showing your support. We hope that you will continue to visit our website as we grow!
