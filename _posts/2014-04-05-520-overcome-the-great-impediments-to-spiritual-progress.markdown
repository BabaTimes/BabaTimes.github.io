**Overcome The Great impediments to Spiritual Progress**

**Divine Life Society Publication: Discourse 3 -** [**The Secret of the Katha Upanishad**](http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/katha/ka_3.html) **by Sri Swami Krishnananda**

_“Overcome Avidya (ignorance), Kama (desire) and Karma (action) by Yajna ( sacrifice), Dana (charity) and Tapas (discipline)”_

**The Great impediments to spiritual progress**

The great impediments to spiritual progress are known as _avidya_, _kama_ and _karma_—ignorance, desire and action. These three aspects of the obstacle are really a single obstacle presenting itself in three different ways. An ignorance of the true and ultimate nature of things is called _avidya_. We call it ignorance, or nescience, or the absence of knowledge, or darkness, etc. This ignorance, _avidya_, breeds a desire for the external objects of sense—_kama_. An ignorance of the character of reality, which is _avidya_, at once presupposes an affirmation of personality, _ahamkara_—and a desire to contact other personalities. _Avidya_ causes _ahamkara_ simultaneously. They are almost inseparable, like the heat and the light of fire. The moment there is this self-affirmation born of ignorance, there is a necessary consequence of it following, viz. a longing to make good what has been lost, by way of contact with things. That is called _kama_. To fulfil _kama_ or desire there is _karma_ or action. So the whole of one’s life is a threefold effort of _avidya_, _kama_ and _karma_— ignorance, desire and action. This is the _tripura_ or the threefold fortress of the demoniacal powers, which Lord Siva is supposed to have broken through with a single arrow. These are the three citadels made of gold, silver and iron, as they say in the Puranas. These are the three knots or granthis—_Brahma-granthi_, _Vishnu-granthi_ and _Rudra-granthi_ —which the _hatha-yogins_ and the _kundalini-yogins_ and the _tantrikas_ speak of—avidya, kama, karma. It is a single power appearing as three independent impediments to the expression of knowledge.

**Overcoming the threefold bondage**

The three fasts of Nachiketas may be compared to the soul’s endeavor to break through these three fortresses, a withdrawal gradually effected from the outer to the inner, overcoming the force of _karma_, overcoming the power of _kama_ and finally overcoming _avidya_. Three forms of _tapas_ or austerity have to be undergone with three aids and with the help of three _sadhanas_ or spiritual practices. You overcome birth and death with these three processes. You gain mastery over those conditions which limit you to the body in all its three layers of expression and to the three planes—the physical, the astral and the celestial. These are the essential bondage of the soul inwardly as well as outwardly limiting its expression and confining it to _samsara_ or earthly existence and suffering. The overcoming of this threefold bondage is the implication of the term ‘_trinachiketa_’ mentioned in the Upanishad.

The instruments that have to be made use of in this effort are the mind, the intellect and the spirit (_manas-buddhi-atma_), all combined in a single-pointed effort—_tribhiretya sandhim_. You have also to perform three actions, to which a reference has been made in the eighteenth chapter of the Bhagavadgita: _trikarma_—_yajna, dana, tapas_. _Yajna_ is the sacrifice which one performs for attaining union with Reality. It includes all forms of self-abnegation and dedication. The Lord himself is compared to _yajna_—_Yajno vai vishnuh_, and in the masterly _Purusha-Sukta_ of the _Vedas_ the whole creation is compared to a _yajna_ of the Supreme Being. _Yajna_ is, therefore, the supreme effort of the soul to unite itself with God. _Dana_ is the charitable disposition of the soul towards others. Charity does not mean only parting with a few rupees or dollars. Charity is an attitude of the mind. It may be expressed in the form of physical action, or it may not be so expressed. It includes charitable feelings, a charitable attitude, conduct and behavior towards others. The capacity to appreciate the situation of others is charity. When you are in a position to enter into the feelings and the actual conditions and circumstances of other souls and other persons and feel as they feel and think as they think and act as they act, not with a sweating effort but with a spontaneous expression of your nature, that would be the essence of a charitable nature—_dana_. _Tapas_ is personal discipline, bodily, verbal as well as mental. One who puts forth this threefold spiritual endeavor overcomes birth and death—_Tarati janma-mrityu_.
