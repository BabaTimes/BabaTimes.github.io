## "To all that come to this happy place: welcome." --Walt Disney
This section is specifically dedicated to our young followers. We hope to use this section to inspire and educate children about aspects of the Hindu religion through fun activities, articles, and arts.
We will be adding a few activities and articles each week, so please keep checking!
