**Meditation – Your Only Duty**

**Divine Life Society Publication: -** [**Dhyana Yoga**](http://www.dlshq.org/messages/medduty.htm) **by Sri Swami Sivananda**

**Introduction**

Meditation is your only duty. You must realize the goal of your life: God-Realization. There are several stages in the path to God-Realization. Purification, concentration, reflection, meditation, illumination, identification, absorption and salvation. Through service you should purify yourself and then proceed through concentration, meditation, etc.; finally you reach the goal of Salvation.

**Time for Meditation**

You must do Brahma Vichara in Brahmamuhurtha. You must enquire "Who am I". Meditation performed for an hour in Brahmamuhurtha is equal to meditation performed for six hours during other periods of the day. If you get up at 4 a.m. you will have time in the early morning for your prayers and meditation. You will charge yourself with Sattva. You will get strength to face the daily battle of life. Morning time is most suitable for meditation. The mind then is not filled with Raga-Dvesha as at other times. You can fill it with Sattva, through meditation, by recitation of Stotras and hymns.

**Method of Meditation**

The mind is duping you every moment. Therefore, wake up now at least and cultivate this discrimination through enquiry into the nature of the Self, through Satsanga, study and meditation.

Meditate on OM. OM is Satchidananda. OM is infinity. Om is perfection and freedom. Meditate on these divine attributes of Nirguna Brahman.

Meditate on the nature of the Self. ‘I am Satchidananda—Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute’. If you are not able to practise this abstract meditation, then meditate on the Sun, the light, or the all-pervading ether or air. Meditate on the light that is shining in your heart. Meditate on the form of your Guru or Saints. Do common meditation for a few minutes, you will know that real peace and bliss are within. Repeat your Ishta Mantra; the mind should not move towards the sense-objects, there is no Vritti; Therefore, you enjoy perfect peace and bliss. Regularly practise such meditation.

**Nama Rupam Na Te Na Me**

You are not the body composed of the five elements. Again and again remember this. Meditate on this. You must find the Atman through reflection and meditation. "Atman knows everything else; and knows itself, too." That is your real Svaroopa. There is no such object in this world.

Meditate and sing: ‘Sivoham Sivoham Sivoham Soham. Satchidananda Svaroopoham.’

Practise Yoga Asanas and Pranayamas, which will purify the body and mind, remove all diseases and help in concentration and meditation.

**Overcome the Obstacles on the path**

Meditate intensely, ceaselessly. You will grow in cheerfulness and joy. Increase the period of meditation.

Sleep always disturbs the aspirant. Take light food at night; dash cold water on the face when sleep tries to overpower you. Chant OM 10 to 12 times. You will be fit for good concentration. You can keep a bright light in your meditation room. You can combine several of these methods; then success is assured.

The moment you sit for meditation all sorts of evil ideas crop up in the mind. You need not be alarmed. You gave them a long rope till now; they have come to fight with you now, because you wish to annihilate them in toto. This is itself a sign of spiritual growth. If you are steady in your Sadhana, all these evil Samskaras will die by themselves. You will be established in meditation and Samadhi.

**The knots or Granthis – Avidya, Kama, Karma**

Original primordial ignorance is Avidya. On account of this ignorance, there arose desire—Kama. In that Pure Absolute, there is no desire. Through desire came action—Karma. Desire is imperfection. You try to seek your happiness in external things. When there is no imperfection, when there is no desire, you will enjoy the bliss of the Atman.

You should meditate regularly at a particular hour of the day. Besides, you should keep up the meditative Bhava throughout the day, by gradual extension. Then you will be tranquil, peaceful, happy and balanced. You will be able to turn more work more efficiently.

**Glory of Meditation**

You have given a definite promise when you were in the womb that you will meditate and realize yourself. You have forgotten your promise.

Chant Om. Taste the bliss of the inner Atman. Every day side by side, along with your duties, practise a little bit of meditation; a little of Kirtan; study of the Gita or other sacred scriptures; and introspection.

Spiritualize all your daily activities. Meditating for half an hour in the morning and then doing all sorts of evil actions during the rest of the day will not help you; the Samskaras created by the morning meditation will be wiped out during the day. You must keep up the spiritual current throughout the day.

If you are regular in your meditation, all doubts and difficulties will vanish by themselves.
