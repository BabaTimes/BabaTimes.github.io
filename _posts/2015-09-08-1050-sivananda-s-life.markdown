**Sivananda’s Life**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**All About Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/download/allsiva.htm#_VPID_5) **by** [**Sri Swami Venkatesananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/venkates.htm)
**‘Happy Birthday, Beloved Gurudev.’**
(In the Sivananda global family, the 8th September is a day where devotees remember that God took birth as Swami Sivananda, to guide and bless humanity.)

Siva's life is God's Guarantee to mankind. It is the Sadhaka's Guide, an open scripture for all to learn from. It is a divine bridge, linking the finite with the Infinite, connecting the land of mortals with the Realm of Immortality.
As a student, he exemplified in himself the ideals of obedience and reverence. The Young Dr. Kuppuswami showed that selfless and dynamic service paved the way to material prosperity, too! He set an example in indiscriminate charity and proved that it _invited_ wealth, peace and happiness. As a flourishing doctor in Malaya during the 1920's, his cheerful countenance and robust body, proclaimed that intense work done with the correct mental attitude strengthened the body, lengthened life, and infused peace into the heart and bliss into the soul of man.
By the single act of renunciation of all that riches and a prosperous career, Siva had taught more than any scripture could, that realisation of the Self is dearer than wealth, dearer than everything, than life itself. Awe-inspiring austerities, begging and pennilessness caused-not unhappiness nor suffering in the heart of the zealous seeker Dr. Kuppuswami, but-an intensification of the faith in God and His Unfailing Mercy.
To mankind blinded by the cataract of materialism, faithlessness and egoism, Siva extended his helping hand-the Divine Life Society. He gave asylum to aspirants in his Ashram. In the Forest Academy, Siva's students have their inner vision unveiled.
This God has clothed himself in human garb. He has come amidst us as a Divine Invitation to a perennial Forest of Immortal Bliss.
