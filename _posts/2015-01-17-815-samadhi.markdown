**Spiritual Message for the Day – Samadhi by Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**

**Samadhi**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Yoga In Daily Life**](http://www.dlshq.org/download/yogadaily.htm#_VPID_81) **by Sri Swami Sivananda**
Om! Om! Om!
Samadhi is deep sleep with the full knowledge of the Self. You get this sleepless sleep when you have burnt the five Jnana Indriyas in the fire of Wisdom, when you have extricated yourself from the clutches of Avidya, Maya or ignorance and when you have controlled all desires.
Tadevartha matranirbhasam   
 Svarupa Soonyameva Samadhi   
  —Patanjali Yoga Sutra.   
 Samadhi Samathovastha Jeevatma Paramatmano   
  —Dattatreya Samhita.
This is not a state of nothingness but a state of “everythingness.” You enter into a state of Absolute Awareness, in which time and place disappear; every place is here; every period of time is ‘now’; and everything is “I”. In this state you have obtained Bliss and Eternal Life.
During cosmic consciousness, you are in touch with universal knowledge and life. The Divine principle flows through you. Your little, individual personality is lost. Your individual will has become merged in the cosmic will or Ishvara’s will. You are aware of the oneness of life. You have the one consciousness—CHINMAYA—that the universe is filled with one life, that the universe is full of life.
You have Tattva Jnana and you see the real universe, which is the essence or background of the universe of Matter, Energy and Mind. You are in a state of Bliss and Ecstasy beyond understanding and description. This is a cognitive trace or Turiya Avastha where Triputi (knowledge, knowable and knower) exists.
