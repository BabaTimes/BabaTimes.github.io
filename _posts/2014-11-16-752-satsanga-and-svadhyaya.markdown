**Rishi Visvamitra and Vasishtha**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Rishi Visvamitra and Vasishtha - Satsanga and Svadhyaya**](http://www.dlshq.org/download/satsanga.htm#_VPID_10) **by Sri Swami Sivananda**
Visvamitra Rishi and Vasishtha had a dispute on one occasion. Visvamitra was a great Tapasvin. He created a third world for Trisankhu through his power of Tapascharya. Visvamitra said to Vasishtha: “Tapas is greater than anything else in this world.” Vasishtha raised his objection and said, “Satsanga is even superior to Tapas.” Then they both decided to go to Brahma for obtaining his opinion on this point. They approached Brahma and placed before him the matter for his final decision. Lord Brahma said, “I am busy with my work of creation. I have no time. Please approach Lord Siva. He has ample time at His disposal. He has got no other work now. His work begins only when Pralaya comes.”
Thereupon, Visvamitra approached Lord Siva for obtaining his views and final decision. Lord Siva said, “Now I am going to see one of my devotees. I have no time now. Please go to Lord Vishnu. He will give a patient hearing to this subject.” Then they went to Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu said, “I cannot decide this matter. Please go to Adi Sesha. He is ever repeating Rama Nama through his thousand tongues. He is a great devotee. He is the proper person to give the final decision. He is very wise too.”
Thereupon, they went to Adi Sesha and placed before him their viewpoints. Adi Sesha replied, “Surely I will give my definite opinion. Please remove the burden of this earth from my head. Then only I will be able to give my view on this subject.” Then they both asked, “O Adi Sesha! Please tell us the way to remove the burden.” Adi Sesha replied, “Please give the fruit of your Tapascharya and Satsanga. I will be relieved of the burden.”
Visvamitra said, “Is that all? Now I give you the fruit of my Tapas of one hundred years.” Adi Sesha was not relieved of the burden on his head. Then Visvamitra said, “Now I give you the fruit of my Tapas for one thousand years.” Then also Adi Sesha was not relieved of his burden. Then Visvamitra said, “Now I give the fruit of my Tapas of my whole life.” Then also Adi Sesha was not relieved of his burden.
Then Vasishtha said, “I give you the fruit of my Satsanga for a second.” At once Adi Sesha was relieved of the burden on his head.
Thereupon Visvamitra put down his head in shame. He did not speak a word either to Adi Sesha or Vasishtha. He fully realized that Satsanga was superior to Tapas. His pride of Tapas tumbled down.
Satsanga is a safe mighty boat which helps the aspirant to cross the ocean of Samsara. The glory of Satsanga cannot be adequately described in words. All scriptures eulogise Satsanga very highly. If one takes recourse to Satsanga, he will get everything. Satsanga is the only potent means to overhaul the vicious Samskaras and to infuse dispassion in the head. Satsanga is a formidable fortress to protect the aspirants from the onslaughts and temptations of Maya. Without Satsanga, you cannot have even an iota of spiritual progress.
Satsanga, Santi, Santosha and Vichara are the four sentinels who stand in front of the door of Moksha. Satsanga is the senior most sentinel. If you make friendship with him, the other three sentinels will at once become your friends and you can easily enter the supreme abode of Moksha and eternal bliss.
