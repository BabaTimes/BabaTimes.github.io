**Spiritual Message for the Day – Guru Bhakti by Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**

**Guru Bhakti**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Divine Life for Children**](http://www.dlshq.org/books/es34.htm#guru) **by** [**Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/siva.htm)
"Spiritual truths will stand revealed only unto him who has great devotion to God and has as great a devotion to his preceptor as he has to God," declares the Upanishad. The Reality or God that is beyond the mind and senses, reason and intellect, can hardly be understood by man by reading books or indulging in intellectual gymnastics even for a hundred lives; the Reality will even then have such significance to him as the characters of the Chinese alphabets to an illiterate African aboriginal.
On the other hand a word from the master’s lips, a touch of his divine hand, a thought from his mastermind, would be enough to enlighten the aspirant’s intellect, to bestow upon him an intuitive realisation of the Reality or God, if only the aspirant had qualified himself for a spiritual communion with the preceptor. How is he to qualify himself? Says the Lord Krishna:
"Know That by prostrating yourself before, serving, and enquiring of, the Great Sages of Self-realisation. They will enlighten you."
A shining illustration of this grand truth we have in Sri Trotaka, one of the four great disciples of Sri Sankaracharya, who was more intent upon serving the illustrious master than on studying the Scriptures; through a mere Sankalpa Sri Sankara bestowed the highest knowledge upon Trotaka who gained all knowledge of the Shastras by mere personal service of the Guru.
Therefore it is that a sincere Sadhaka firmly believes:
The Guru’s Form Itself is fit to be meditated upon; the Guru’s Feet are the object of the Sadhaka’s worship; the Guru’s words are gospel-truths; and the Guru’s Grace is the bestower of Immortality.
