**Shirdi Sai Baba (Maalik Ek) 2010 - Movie Review**
* * *
Shirdi Sai Baba (Maalik Ek), (October 29, 2010), a spiritual movie is directed by Deepak Balraj Vij, and music has been scored by Anup Jalota, who has also appeared as Das Ganu.
The movie which gives us a glimpse of the Saint Sai Baba of Shirdi, through some real life stories has a refreshing modern day appeal with classic songs like Raham Nazar Karna and songs like Sab ka Ek.
The small budget movie, is not up to Bollywood standards but the crux of the story is very well projected with some good acting performances by Anup Jalota, Suresh Oberai, Dharmendra, Vikram Gokhale, Rohini Hattangadi, Shammi Kapoor, Manoj Kumar, Divya Dutta, etc. And of course, Jackie Shroff, who has played the lead role as Shirdi Sai Baba, has given up his old ways of living and has adopted a different life style.
Through this movie, Baba’s words of “Shraddha & Saburi” along with “Sab Ka Maalik Ek”, continues to resonate in our ears and one’s faith in Sai Baba, whose leelas have spread all over the world, increases manifold. “There are believers and non-believers. And one day, we all become believers.”
