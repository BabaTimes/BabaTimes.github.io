**Upanishad**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Dialogues From The Upanishads**](http://www.dlshq.org/books/es78.htm#intro) **by** [**Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/siva.htm)
**Om Sri Sadguru Paramatmane Namah**
The word _Upanishad_ is formed by adding the _Krip_ suffix and the prefixes _Upa_ and _Ni_ to the root _Shad,_ meaning (1) to shatter or kill; (2) to attain; (3) to loosen. By the word Upanishad is denoted the knowledge of the knowable entity inculcated by the work which is to be commented on. By what etymological process this knowledge is denoted by the term Upanishad is now explained. This knowledge is called Upanishad by virtue of its signification that it _shatters_ or _destroys,_ the seed of Samsara such as ignorance and the rest, in those seekers after emancipation, who, devoid of all desires for objects seen and heard of, acquire the knowledge called Upanishad to be hereafter explained, and with their mind firmly concentrated therein meditate on it; for, it will also be said later on ‘well ascertaining that he will be freed from the jaws of death’; or the knowledge of Brahman is called Upanishad because of the fact that it leads to Brahman, in that it makes the seekers after emancipation just above described attain the highest Brahman; for, it will be said later on, ‘having attained the Brahman he becomes untainted and immortal’; or, even ‘the knowledge of Agni’ is denoted by the term Upanishad, because of its connection with the meaning of the root ‘to loosen’; for the knowledge of Agni, the first born, the knower, born of Brahman—the subject matter of the second of the boons asked for—leads to the attainment of heaven and thus loosens or enfeebles the lot of misery, such as residence in the womb, birth, old age, etc., continually recurring in this world. It will also be said later on, ‘having reached heaven they enjoy immortality’. It may be urged that students apply the term Upanishad even to the book, as when they say ‘we shall study or teach the Upanishad’. This is no fault; as the meaning of the root _sad, i.e.,_ the killing of the cause of Samsara, etc., cannot attach to the mere work but attaches to knowledge; and even the mere work may also be denoted by that word, because it serves the selfsame purpose, as when it is said ‘ghee verily is life’. The word Upanishad, therefore, is used in its primary sense when it is used to denote knowledge; but it is used by courtesy, i.e., in a secondary sense, to denote the work. Thus by the mere analytical explanation of the word Upanishad, those who are fully competent to acquire knowledge have been stated. The whole subject matter of knowledge has also been stated to be the highest Brahman, the internal Atman of all. The fruit of this knowledge has also been stated to be the thorough release from the bondage of Samsara consisting in the attainment of the Brahman.
The meaning of the Upanishad is, it may be either because it lessens the numerous evils of conception, birth, old age, disease, etc., in persons who take kindly to this knowledge of Brahman and approach it with faith and devotion; or, because it makes them reach Brahman; or, because it totally destroys the cause of Samsara, such as ignorance, etc., thus from the several meanings of the root _shad_ preceded by _upani._
