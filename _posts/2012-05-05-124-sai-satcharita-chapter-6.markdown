Sai Satcharita Chapter 6
* * *
Gopalrao Gund, a great devotee of Sai Baba, was blessed with a baby boy. He wanted to celebrate the occasion with a grand festival on the day of _Rama Navami._ Gopalrao Gund asked Baba for advice, who granted His permission for the celebration. Unfortunately, there was a scarcity of water in the village, and the remaining water was salty. Upon hearing this news, Baba dropped flowers into the well, making the water sweet. After the celebration, Gopalrao Gund and his friend, Nanasaheb Nimonkar, added two embroidered flags to the top of Babaâ€™s mosque. This act is still performed in Shirdi on days of celebration.
The festival of _Rama Navami_ has since been a grand celebration in Shirdi. Each year, more devotees became involved in the process, adding songs, music, and traditions to the celebrations. Sai Baba was happy when His followers started becoming involved in the festival because people were willing put aside their differences and work together to make the celebrations successful.
