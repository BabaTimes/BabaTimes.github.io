**Nididhyasana**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Discourse 5 - Commentary on the Panchadasi**](http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/panchadasi/pan_05.html) **by Sri Swami Krishnananda**
God cannot be conceived as finite. Nor is it possible to conceive the infinite. No contact with Brahman is possible, ordinarily. _Vikalpatva_ or _nirvikalpatva_, that is finitude or infinitude as associated with Brahman, may be considered as futile arguments in the case of quality, action, species, objectivity and relation. _Guna_ is quality, _kriya_ is action, _jati_ is species, _dravya_ is object, s_ambandha_ is relation, _vastu_ is anything whatsoever. Hence, in any one of these categories that we find in this world, the same difficulty will arise if we start envisaging these things either as finite or as infinite.
Nothing finally can be looked upon as either finite or infinite. If we think that a thing is neither finite nor infinite, it is inconceivable. Anything that is relative cannot be conceived. The modern science of relativity also takes us to the same conclusion that it is not as it appears to us. That is why it is called _maya_ – a jugglery-like thing that is appearing before us. If we try to probe into it, we will find it is not there at all, as night vanishes when the sun rises or darkness vanishes when the flash of a torch is thrown on it. It is because our knowledge is not operating, the whole thing looks very solid, so three-dimensional, so real. If we throw the flashlight on our understanding, we will find it vanishes. It cannot be conceived at all as either existent in this manner or existent in that manner – neither finite, not infinite, which means to say that it is not there at all. Such is this world.
The category of finitude and infinitude, and the category of relation of one thing with the other are all imagined by the conditioning factors of the mind. Brahman is above all that we can imagine in our mind. This kind of study that we have made is called _sravana._ We have heard a lot about the nature of the world, the nature of the individual, the nature of Brahman. We have studied Ishvara, _jagat_ and _jiva_ in some measure. What is the nature of these great principles God, world and individual?
But mere hearing or studying is not sufficient. When you return home, you must ponder over this deeply. The ideas that have been made to enter into your mind through the medium of your hearing should enter your heart. They should become objects of deep investigation, Self-investigation. The mind withdraws into itself all the ideas that it has collected by hearing and deeply bestows these considerations. That is called _manana._
_Sravana_ is hearing, learning, studying. _Manana_ is deep thinking. If you merely hear and go away and again hear tomorrow, it will be what is humorously called ‘Eustachian philosophy’, which means that what you hear through one ear goes out through the other ear. Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj used to say there are Eustachian philosophers. They understand nothing. It does not go inside.
Unless we bestow deep thought on what we have heard, that knowledge which we have gained by hearing will not be part of our nature. We will be sitting independently as we were earlier, and knowledge will be outside in space. So it has to be brought into the depths of our understanding by deep reflection. That process is called _manana._ Even that is not sufficient. We have to become that knowledge itself.
The deep association of ourselves with this knowledge is _nididhyasana._ Firstly, we hear and study. Secondly, we bestow deep thought and investigate into the substance and essentiality of what we have heard and studied, and make it a part and parcel of our daily thought and understanding. But when this process goes on continuously day in and day out, it becomes the very spirit of our nature. We do not merely know, we actually become the existence of it. Knowledge is not merely a property that we have gained by hearing or studying. It is not a quality of our intellect, as an academic qualification. It is our very substance. Knowledge is Being. _Chit_ is _Sat._ So when knowledge that we have gained by _sravana_ and _manana_ becomes our very substance itself, we move like God Himself in the world. That is _jivanmukta lakshana._ That condition is _nididhyasana tattva,_ a continuous flow of knowledge without break, which becomes the essence of our person. This is called _nididhyasana._
Deep meditation, which is _nididhyasana_ is, in the beginning, involved in three processes – the meditating consciousness, the object on which meditation is carried on, and the process of meditation. Therefore, three things are involved – _triputi._ There is someone who is meditating, there is something on which meditation is being carried on, and some process of knowledge is linking the subject with the object, connecting the meditator with the object meditated upon. So when we meditate, in the beginning we will have a consciousness of three things. We will feel that we are there contemplating, meditating. We will feel that there is something on which we are concentrating. And we will also know that there is a relation between us.
When by deep concentration – going further, deeper – the consciousness of our being there and the consciousness of a process going on also are dropped, our consciousness merges into that object, and we become the very object itself. The very _artha,_ the very target, the very ideal, the very aim becomes us. We are not contemplating something; we have become that. That becoming of the identity of our consciousness with the very object which we are concentrating upon, losing the consciousness of an individuality and the process of concentration – the identity of the subject with the object, the merger of the consciousness perceiving with the object concentrated upon – is called _samadhi._
