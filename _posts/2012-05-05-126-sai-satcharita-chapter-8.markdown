Sai Satcharita Chapter 8
* * *
The author describes how taking birth in a human form is double-edged sword. Humans can make the best of the situation or ruin the opportunity by squandering in vices. The virtues of forgiveness, charity, and benevolence will help people move towards becoming more pure and, in turn, more in tune with God. By submitting oneself to a guru, the path to enlightenment seems clearer. Sai Baba’s devotees were known for being humble and pious due to their love for Him. Baba, in turn, showed love to anyone in whom He saw God.
One such example is Tatya Kote’s mother, Bayajabai, who was known for her service to Baba. She would spend time everyday searching for Baba in the forest where He did penance. Though she was poor, Bayajabai would bring Baba food and vegetables everyday and feed Him throughout his stay in the forest. Baba was immensely pleased by her faith and service and helped both Bayajabai and her son when they needed His help.
