**Thoughts Chisel Your Countenance**
**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**Thought Power**](http://www.dlshq.org/download/thought_power.htm#_VPID_28) **by** [**Gurudev Sri Swami Sivananda**](http://www.dlshq.org/saints/siva.htm)
**Om Sri Sadguru Paramatmane Namah**
Your face is like a gramophone record or plate. Whatever you think is at once written on your face.
Every vicious thought serves as a chisel or needle to write down the thoughts on your countenance. Your faces are covered with the scars and wounds which are made by the vicious thoughts of hatred, anger, lust, jealousy, revenge, etc.
From the nature of the scar on your face, we can at once read your state of mind. We can at once diagnose the disease of your mind.
He who thinks that he can hide his thoughts is a dunce of the first water. His position is like that of the ostrich which, when chased by the hunters, hides its head underneath the sand and imagines that it cannot be seen by anyone.
Face is the index of the mind. Face is the mould of the mind. Every thought cuts a groove in the face. A divine thought brightens the face. An evil thought darkens the face. Continued divine thoughts increase the aura or halo.
Continued evil thoughts increase the depth of dark impressions, just as the continued striking of a vessel against the edge of a well while drawing water makes deeper and deeper hollow on the vessel. The facial expression truly advertises the inner state of the mind or the true contents of the mind.
The face is like an advertisement-board wherein is advertised what is going inside the mind. Your thoughts, sentiments, modes and emotions produce their strong impressions on the face.
In your face, you can hardly hide your thoughts. You may wrongly think that you have kept up your thoughts in secret. The thoughts of lust, greed, jealousy, anger, revenge, hatred, etc., at once produce their deep impressions on your face.
The face is a faithful recorder and a sensitive registering apparatus to register and record all the thoughts that are in your mind.
The face is a polished mirror to indicate the nature of the mind and its contents at a particular time.
**Note:** Pitripaksha 2015 – Sept 28-Oct 12 (Mahalaya Amavasya)
