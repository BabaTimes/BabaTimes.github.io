Sai Satcharita Chapter 2

* * *

Hemadpant, the author of Shri Sai Satcharitra, did not think that he was worthy enough to write such a historic piece of work on Baba. He considered the momentous life of Sai Baba, and believed that he would not be able to achieve his goal of telling the world the stories of His grace, love, and teachings.



Hempadpant believed that the only reason he was brave enough to start his work was because he had faith in his Guru. He argued that a guru could not make a lazy man do work. When Hemadpant posed the question to Baba, He replied that a guru is like a guide: no matter how dangerous or tough a path is, a guide will be able to lead one to oneâ€™s destination without approaching any harm. People have been able to attain self-realization and the virtues necessary for progress by submitting to their Gurus through faith and patience (_shraddha_ and _saburi_). 



Hemadpant looked to his Guru, Shri Sai Baba, before starting his work. He took a trip to see Baba in Shirdi, and obtained a _darshan_ from Him, where he was able to surrender himself, his doubts, and his ambitions at His feet. With this act, his thoughts and ideas were changed, allowing him to start his work without any worries and with the blessings of the Lord.
