**Operation of Subtle Impressions**

**Divine Life Society Publication:** [**The Mysterious Mind and Its Control**](http://www.dlshq.org/messages/mind.htm#subtle) **by Sri Swami Chidananda**

Just as seed is sown in the soil, so the impression of every experience is made on the mind. These impressions of experiences are "alive". They have in them the direct power to recreate the entire experiences which caused them in the first instance. (In fact, each impression seeks a repetition of the corresponding original experience.)

This is the circle in which the human being is caught. The mind wants to be full of desires and agitation and does not want to be controlled. Unless it is watched and disciplined daily, man will live his life like a puppet and end his life in slavery.

When man has an understanding of the activity of the mind (how the "I" thought is the very root thought of the mind) and finds out how it moves, then he will be able to get a hold over it.

The solution lies in the complete reversal of this process. First you must try to control the externalization of the mind by overcoming desire. Right thinking and discriminative reasoning hold a key to this solution. The great thing is to know yourself to be distinct and different from the desires. YOU are entirely separate and apart from all desire and thought. YOU are Consciousness, a being deeper than, and fully beyond, mind and all its countless modes. This is the secret key. You are not the mind. Know yourself to be independent of the mind. This is very difficult to realize because the mind is so persistent and your present feeling of identity with it is so complete. The subtle "I" thought is so elusive and slippery as to defy a steady analysis and it escapes calm observation, but when you have managed through persistent and repeated attempts to grasp it and dissect it, when you know yourself to be distinct and apart from it, then you are given a glorious vantage point from which you can view the mind. Formerly, when you were indisciplined and indulgent, you were helpless; but now when you stand aside and apart from the mind and the "I" thought, you are the master. You can observe it as the Witness-Consciousness apart from it.

You must be able to thus perceive all the modes of your entire personality. You are the silent, unattached Witness-Consciousness within. You are not the senses; you are not the mind; you are not the thought, emotion or sentiment. You are beyond even the intellect, which is deluded and overcome by this illusion of false identification. Thus, what you have to work up to, ultimately, is that you are not even this "I" thought which is dearest to you, and to which you are clinging. Even this "I" thought is merely a mode of the mind, like any other thought. The true "I" (the real YOU within) is a supramental factor. You are a pure Being distinct from this "I" idea which the mind habitually thinks. Transcend the mind. You are pure Consciousness and your true identity is "Conscious Being". This Consciousness is the basis of your Being whence the "I" thought is derived. In your present state of delusion, this is not perceived. The moment the "I" thought is conceived by the mind, the mind is already afflicted by the most pernicious of diseases. This disease, according to the _Vedas_, is the superimposition of yourself upon the physical body.

To make the outgoing stream of thought in-going is the great science of the mind that has to be learned. Begin by non-cooperating with the mind. Whenever the mind builds up a want and wants to do a thing, assert your independence and say, "No, I will not do it", and whenever the mind refuses to do something, say, "You shall do it". Always tell yourself: "I am the master of this house (body-mind). I will not be dominated and commanded by the desire-ridden mind. I shall do the dictating. I will assert my mastery and make the mind listen to me and obey me".

Mind, as thought, is not overpowering. Mind, as "I", is also not overpowering, because it has no dynamism in it; it is just a habitual mode of the mind. But, when desires are evolved out of the "I" and "mine" thoughts, and when imagination is brought into play the mischief starts. The more a thought is dwelt upon, the more quickly it grows into the dynamic form of a desire. Therefore, the moment that a thought appears, stamp it out. The Hindus say that great forest fires can be averted if you stamp upon the tiny sparks right at the beginning.

Supposing the thought does not reach the condition of a desire, still you must try to remember that it is not YOU. Do not couple yourself with it. Do not get involved in it. Do not identify yourself with it. Know yourself to be apart from the thought and do not fulfill it. Disconnect yourself from the thought and stand aside.

Even though the mind seems to be capable of thinking a hundred different thoughts at a time, the precise scientific truth about it is that the mind can think only a single thought at a given moment. Due to its finite nature, the mind can think only serially. The mind thinks with such rapidity that it seems as though thoughts are simultaneous, yet only one thought is ever entertained in the mind at one time.

From this fact it has been suggested that if you consciously raise certain thoughts independently, then no other thought can occupy the field of the mind at that time. Create your own thoughts masterfully and you will be free from plague of loose and miscellaneous thinking. Control the mind. Create right and noble thoughts; then no other unworthy or negative thought can persist.
