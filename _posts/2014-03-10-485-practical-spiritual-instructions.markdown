**Practical Spiritual Instructions**

**Divine Life Society Publication: -** [**Essence of Yoga**](http://www.dlshq.org/download/essence_yoga.htm#_VPID_45) **by Sri Swami Sivananda**

Thou art divine. Live up to it. Feel and realize thy divine nature. Do not murmur when you get difficulties, troubles, tribulations and diseases. Every difficulty is an opportunity for you to develop your will and power of endurance and to grow strong. Conquer the difficulties one by one. This is the beginning of a new life, a life of expansion, glory and divine splendor. Aspire and draw. Grow. Expand. Build up all positive qualities, the Daiva-Sampatti, _viz._, fortitude, patience and courage that are dormant in you. Tread the spiritual path and realize: 'I am the Immortal Self."

Never weep even if you lose your near and dear relations. Births and deaths are the two illusory scenes in the marvelous drama of this world. They are all the jugglery of Maya. In reality nobody comes and nobody goes. Atman alone exists. Atman is Brahman or the Immortal Soul.

Be hopeful always. Face all difficulties, tribulations and anxieties in life with a smile. Always repeat the formula "Even this will pass away." You will then be always beyond grief and sorrow.

Pain is a blessing in disguise. Pain is an eye-opener. Pain is your silent teacher. Pain will turn your mind towards God. Many old Karmas have to be purged out quickly by the thirsting aspirant before he attains the blissful Samadhi (superconscious state). Therefore, the thirsting aspirant only will get more troubles. Become a spiritual warrior and chop off the thoughts and subtle forms of secret desires for enjoyment. A glorious brilliant future is awaiting you.

Conquer difficulties one by one. Stand adamant. Root yourself in the immortal Sat-Chit-Ananda Atman or Self within. Develop a magnanimous, serene, calm and poised mental state. Sing "Anandoham, Anandoham-I am all bliss. I am all bliss."

To live is to fight for the ideal and goal. Life is conquest. Life is a series of awakenings. Conquer your mind and the senses. These are your real enemies. Live under lifelong vows. Conquer your internal and external nature. Fight against the antagonistic dark evil forces through Japa and meditation.

If you are firm in your resolves to reach the highest goal of Yoga, if you have firm determination to attain the aim of spiritual life, you will rise up again and march forward even if you have a temporary fall. Feel the divine within you. Open yourself fully to the divine influence. Develop burning desire for the attainment of God-consciousness and burning dispassion (Vairagya) for worldly enjoyments. Abandon all worldly ambitions and mundane desires. Soar high always in the realms of higher spiritual knowledge. Show your moral courage and spiritual strength now, O Ram!

Spiritual life is not mere idle talk. It is not mere sensation. It is actual living in Atman. It is a transcendental experience of unalloyed bliss.

May you all become immortal and drink deep the divine nectar of perennial joy and eternal bliss!
