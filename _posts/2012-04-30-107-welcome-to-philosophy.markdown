## **The Philosophy and Spiritualism of Sri Aurobindo is a theory of evolution detailed in Sri Aurobindo's "The Life Divine". It argues that humankind is not the last rung in the evolutionary scale, but can evolve spiritually to a future state of supramental existence. This further evolutionary step would lead to a divine life on Earth characterized by a supramental or truth-consciousness, and a transformed and divinised life and material form.**
