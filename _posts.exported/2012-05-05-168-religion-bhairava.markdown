<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">Bhairav</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';"> means terrible or frightful in Sanskrit. Lord Bhairava is said to be the fierce manifestation of Lord Shiva associated with annihilation. He is depicted with frowning, angry eyes and sharp, tiger’s teeth and flaming hair, stark naked except for garlands of skulls and a coiled snake about his neck.&nbsp; His ornaments are twisted serpents, which serves as earrings, bracelets, anklets, and sacred thread (Ajnopavita). He is sometimes shown wearing a tiger skin and a ritual apron composed of human bones. In his four hands he carries a noose, trident, drum and skull. He is often shown accompanied by a black dog.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">Dogs (particularly black dogs) were often considered the most appropriate form of sacrifice to Bhairava, and he is sometimes shown as holding a severed human head, with a dog waiting at one side, in order to catch the blood from the head.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';"></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">Bhairava is the embodiment of fear, and it is aid that those who meet him must confront the source of their own fears. He is also said to safeguard the devotees on all eight directions. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';"></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">According to Shiv Mahapuranam, an arrogant Brahma tells Vishnu, that he being the supreme creator, everyone including Vishnu and Shiva must worship him.&nbsp; This angered Shiva who in reality is the creator of all.&nbsp; He manifested in the form of Bhairava and beheaded one of Brahma’s five heads. Bhairava incurred the Brahmahathi dosha and had to roam as Bhikshatana, until he had been absolved of the sin. Kala Bhairava is depicted as carrying the decapitated head of Brahma.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';"></span></p>
<span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;"></span></span><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;"></span></span>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">It is also said that Brahma created Saraswati from his imagination (Manasaputri), to help solve the cosmic confusion which arose due to the creation of Universe. Shatarupa was born and she presented Brahma with the wealth of knowledge and wisdom.&nbsp; But Brahma was infatuated with her beauty and pursued her.&nbsp; He even &nbsp;sprouted a fifth head to gaze at her continuously.&nbsp; This unlawful lust caused an imbalance in the universe and Lord Shiva took the form of Bhairava to put an end to this. He confronted Brahma and cut off his fifth head which brought him to his senses. He then performed a yagna to purify himself, reciting mantras with his four heads for salvation.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">Bhairavi, the consort of the Bhairava, is also a fierce and terrifying aspect of the Devi who is virtually indistinguishable from Kali.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';"></span></p>
