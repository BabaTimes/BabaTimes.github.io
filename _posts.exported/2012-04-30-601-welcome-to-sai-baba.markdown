<h2><hr /><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;">Sai Baba of Shirdi holds a unique place in the rich tradition of saints in India. Baba, an embodiment of self-realization and perfection, did not come solely to preach but to awaken mankind through his messages of love and righteousness. The early life of Sai Baba is still cloaked in mystery as there isn't any reliable record of the Baba's birth and parentage. It is believed that Baba was born somewhere between 1838 and 1842 AD in a place called Pathri in Marathwada in Central India. Sai Baba arrived at Shirdi as a nameless entity at a young age tempered by the discipline of penance and austerity.&nbsp;</span></h2>
