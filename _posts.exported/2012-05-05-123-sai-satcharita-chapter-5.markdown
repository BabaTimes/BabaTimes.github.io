<p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 14pt; color: #808080;">Sai Satcharita Chapter 5<br /></span></p>
<hr />
<div style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">Shri Sai Baba was only in Shirdi for a few years before suddenly disappearing. His devotees were baffled that He had left them on their own, but knew that if they were devout, He would return to them. Baba returned to Shirdi in quite an amusing way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">Chand Patil, a wealthy man who lived in Nizam, lost his horse while on a trip to Aurangabad. While on his way home, Patil came across a queer man sitting under a mango tree. He wore a <i>Kafni</i> (a long robe) and a cap on His head, which made Him look like a <i>Fakir </i>(a Muslim saint). The man called out to Chand Patil, and asked him what his problems were. Patil told him that he had lost his horse, and had not found him after months of searching. The <i>Fakir </i>told Patil to search in the dam close to where they were sitting, where Patil found his horse.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">Chand Patil returned to the <i>Fakir</i> with his horse, where the two men started to smoke a <i>chillim</i> (pipe). Patil realized that there was no fire to light the lamp nor was there any water to wet the pipe with. Patil watched with amazement as the <i>Fakir</i> struck the <i>chillim</i> on the ground, starting a flame. When the men had finished smoking the <i>chillim</i>, He struck it against the ground again, magically soaking it with water. Once the two men had rested, Chand Patil invited the <i>Fakir</i> to his home so that he could be a part of his nephew’s marriage celebrations. The <i>Fakir</i> accepted Patil’s hospitality, and went to his home the next day, where He was again invited to attend the marriage of Patil’s nephew in Shirdi.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">Chand Patil’s whole family and the <i>Fakir</i> went to Shirdi for the marriage, but when the <i>Fakir</i> stepped off the carts onto the ground, a villager, Mahalaspati, cheered “<i>Ya sai,”</i> which meant “Welcome, Sai.” After that day, the <i>Fakir</i> was known as Sai Baba, and remained in Shirdi from then on.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">Sai Baba had no home or earthly possessions, but started to live in an old mosque in the middle of Shirdi to serve the people of the village.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">Baba used to borrow oil from local shopkeepers, called the Banias, to light the mosque throughout the night. After some time, the Banias decided that they would no longer supply Baba with oil. Baba was not worried by this, and returned to the mosque with his <i>tumrel </i>(tin pot). He added water to the few drops of oil in the <i>tumrel</i>, drank it, and returned it to the container. He then used this water to fill all the lamps, and lit them. The lamps burned throughout the night, bringing shame to the Banias, who then apologized to Baba and repented for their mistake. <br /></span></div>
