<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">South Asian weddings are very bright events, filled with ritual and celebration, that continue for several days. They are generally not small affairs, with anywhere between 100 to 10,000 people attending. Often, it is possible that many of the attendees are unknown to the bride and <span class="mw-redirect">groom</span> themselves. Though most <span class="mw-redirect">Indian marriages are arranged</span>, some couples in urban areas have what are known as "love marriages", in which the partners decide to marry each other without family involvement or assistance. The traditional Indian wedding is about two families being brought together socially, with as much emphasis placed on the families concerned coming closer as the individuals involved.</span></p>
