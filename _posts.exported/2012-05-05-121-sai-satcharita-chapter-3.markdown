<hr />
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">A story in which Baba’s love is shown is in the story of Rohilla. Rohilla, a tall and strong man, came to Shirdi in search of Baba. He stayed in Shirdi and cried out the Lord’s name throughout the night, which disturbed the people of the village. The villagers came to Baba, asking him to help them with this problem. Baba ignored the pleas of the people, and told them that Rohilla’s wife was a bad woman, and that his cries at night were keeping her away from the village. In reality, Baba knew that Rohilla had no wife. He prayed loudly to keep his mind away from any bad thoughts (<i>durbuddhi</i>), keeping his mind and heart pure. Sai Baba supported Rohilla because he chanted the Lord’s name, showing his love for God and His teachings.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">The purpose of a lighthouse is to lead boats to safety, avoiding any rocks or dangers along the shoreline.&nbsp; The stories of the miracles (<i>leelas</i>) performed by Sai Baba serve a similar purpose in the lives of His devotees. Stories of Baba’s love and caring will guide people along the right path, helping them to lead better lives. Baba’s love is all-encompassing, and is evident at all times.</span> </span></div>
