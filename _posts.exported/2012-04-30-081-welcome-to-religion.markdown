<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">Religion is a collection of <span class="mw-redirect">cultural systems</span>, <span class="mw-redirect">belief systems</span>, and <span class="mw-redirect">worldviews</span> that relate humanity to spirituality and, sometimes, to moral values. Many religions have narratives, symbols, traditions and sacred histories that are intended to give meaning to life or to explain the <span class="mw-redirect">origin of life</span> or the universe. They tend to derive <span class="mw-redirect">morality</span>, ethics, religious laws or a preferred lifestyle from their ideas about the cosmos and human nature</span><span>.</span></p>
