<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">The Matrimandir took 37 years to build, from the laying of the foundation stone at sunrise on 21 February 1971 - the Motherâ€™s 93rd birthday - to completion in May 2008. It is in the form of a huge sphere surrounded by twelve pedestals. The central dome is covered by golden discs and reflects sunlight, which gives the structure its characteristic radiance. Inside this central dome is a meditation hall known as the inner chamber - this contains the largest optically-perfect glass globe in the world. The Matrimandir, and its surrounding gardens in the central Peace Area, is fully open to the public by appointment.</span></p>
