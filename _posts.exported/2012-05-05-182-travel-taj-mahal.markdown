<h1 style="line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #000000;">Taj Mahal<br /></span></strong></h1>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">The Taj Mahal is a <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">white marble</span> <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">mausoleum</span> located in <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Agra</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">India</span>. It was built by <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Mughal</span> <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">emperor</span> <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Shah Jahan</span> in memory of his third wife, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Mumtaz Mahal</span>. The Taj Mahal is widely recognized as "the jewel of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Muslim art</span> in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.It coveres area about 221 hectare (552 Acres) which include 38 hectare taj mahal and 183 hectare taj protected forest are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Taj Mahal is the finest example of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Mughal architecture</span>, a style that combines elements from <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Persian</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Turkish</span> and <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Indian</span> architectural styles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">In 1983, the Taj Mahal became a UNESCO <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">World Heritage Site</span>. While the white <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">domed</span> <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">marble</span> mausoleum is the most familiar component of the Taj Mahal, it is actually an integrated complex of structures. The construction began around 1632 and was completed around 1653, employing thousands of artisans and craftsmen. The construction of the Taj Mahal was entrusted to a board of architects under imperial supervision, including Abd ul-Karim Ma'mur Khan, Makramat Khan, and <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Ustad Ahmad Lahauri</span>. Lahauri is generally considered to be the principal designer. </span></p>
<h2 style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"><span class="mw-headline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Origin and inspiration</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">In 1631, Shah Jahan, emperor during the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Mughal empire</span>'s period of greatest prosperity, was grief-stricken when his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, died during the birth of their 14th child, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Gauhara Begum</span>. Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632. The court chronicles of Shah Jahan's grief illustrate the love story traditionally held as an inspiration for Taj Mahal. The principal mausoleum was completed in 1648 and the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later. Emperor Shah Jahan himself described the Taj in these words: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Should guilty seek asylum here,<br /> Like one pardoned, he becomes free from sin.<br /> Should a sinner make his way to this mansion,<br /> All his past sins are to be washed away.<br /> The sight of this mansion creates sorrowing sighs;<br /> And the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes.<br /> In this world this edifice has been made;<br /> To display thereby the creator's glory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Persian architecture</span> and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Timurid</span> and Mughal buildings including; the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Gur-e Amir</span> (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Samarkand</span>), <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Humayun's Tomb</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb</span> (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan's own <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Jama Masjid</span> in <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Delhi</span>. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">sandstone</span>, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">semi-precious stones</span>, and buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.</span></span></p>
