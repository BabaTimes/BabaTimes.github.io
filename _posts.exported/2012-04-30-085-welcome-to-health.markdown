<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">Health is the level of functional or metabolic efficiency of a living being. In humans, it is the general condition of a person's mind, body and spirit, usually meaning to be free from illness, injury or pain (as in “<i>good health</i>” or “<i>healthy</i>”). The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as having a lack of operational value and the problem created by use of the word "complete", it remains the most enduring.<sup> </sup>Classification systems such as the <span class="mw-redirect">WHO Family of International Classifications</span>, including the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the <span class="mw-redirect">International Classification of Diseases</span> (ICD), are commonly used to define and measure the components of health.</span></p>
