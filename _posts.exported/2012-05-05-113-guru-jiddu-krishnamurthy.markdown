<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">J. Krishnamurthi was an enlightened soul, a writer and philosopher whose mission was to bring about a positive change in human personality.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">Jiddu Krishnamurthi was born on May 11, 1895 in Madanapalle, Andra Pradesh state and is from a family of telugu speaking Brahmins.&nbsp; He was at most times assumed to be mentally retarded and punished by his parents and teachers for revealing his psychic experiences.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">Through his association with the theosophical society, he was able to bloom into a true spiritual guru. He believed that everyone should meditate and &nbsp;have a more spiritual approach to living. He respected humanity and nature and wanted everyone to treat themselves well and preserve Earth.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">He did not encourage intellectual pursuits.&nbsp; He believed that the ultimate truth can be realized only through each seeker’s awareness to his own experience, understanding and observation leading to involution (inward growth).</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">Later he said, “I maintain that truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect. That is my point of view, and I adhere to that absolutely and unconditionally. Truth, being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any organization be formed to lead or coerce people along a particular path. ... This is no magnificent deed, because I do not want followers, and I mean this. The moment you follow someone you cease to follow Truth”.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">He compared himself to Thomas Edison, meaning that the seeker has to just flick the switch as all the hard work had been done by him through his process of self-realization. He wanted seekers to simply live the teachings laid out by him, in order to attain the higher consciousness.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">He attained liberation through his own personal experiences and observations and died on February 17, 1986.</span></div>
