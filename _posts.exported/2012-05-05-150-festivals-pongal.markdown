<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Thai Pongal is a harvest festival celebrated by <span style="text-decoration: none;">Tamilians</span> in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the Indian Union Territory of Pondicherry and Sri Lanka. This South Indian festival, Thai Pongal, is timed by an astronomical event - the winter solstice. Pongal is traditionally dedicated to the Sun God Surya, and marks the beginning of the northward journey of the Sun from its southernmost-limit, a movement traditionally referred to as uttarayana It coincides with the festival <span style="text-decoration: none;">Makara Sankranthi</span> celebrated throughout India as the winter harvest, and is usually held from January 13â€“15 in the Gregorian calendar i.e. from the last day of the Tamil month <span style="text-decoration: none;">Maargazhi</span> to the third day of Thai. This also represents the Indic solstice when the sun purportedly enters the 10th house of the Indian zodiac i.e. Makaram or Capricorn.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">The saying "Thai Pirandhal Vazhi Pirakkum" meaning "the commencement of Thai paves the way for new opportunities" is often quoted regarding the Pongal festival. Pongal Tamils thank the Sun god for the good harvest and consecrate the first grain to him on this 'Surya Mangalyam'. Tamilians decorate their homes with banana and mango leaves and embellish the floor with decorative patterns drawn using rice flour. </span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">The history may well be more than 1000 years old although some are of the view that the festival is older. Epigraphic evidence suggests the celebration of the Puthiyeedu during the Medieval Chola empire days. It is thought that Puthiyeedu meant the first harvest of the year.<sup> </sup>The Sangam era literary work, the Paripaadal, refers to a fast by unmarried girls in honor of the God Vishnu in the month of Thai, known as the Thai Nonbu. The link between that fast and today's harvest festival needs to be further researched. Tamils refer to Pongal as "Tamizhar Thirunaal" (meaning "the festival of Tamils") Makara Sankranti in turn is referred to in the Surya Siddhanta.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">The day preceding Pongal is called Bhogi when people discard old things and focus on new belongings. The disposal of derelict things is similar to Holika in North India. The people assemble at dawn in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh to light a bonfire to discard old used possessions. The house is cleaned, painted and decorated to give a festive look. In villages, the horns of oxen and buffaloes are painted in colors and in most rural parts of Andhra Pradesh people celebrate it in a grand way as most of them would have their harvest ready or even would have made money out of the harvests.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">This tradition is observed on the same day in Andhra Pradesh where it is also called "Bhogi." The fruits from the harvest are collected (such as regi pallu and sugar cane), along with flowers of the season, in a ceremony called Bhogi Pallu Money is often placed into a mixture of Bhogi Pallu, and the mixture is poured over children, who then collect the money and sweet fruits.</span></p>
