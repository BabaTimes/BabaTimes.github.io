<h1 style="line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #000000;">Kathakali</span></strong></h1>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">Kathakali</span><span style="font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';"> is a highly stylized classical <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">Indian</span> <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">dance</span>-<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">drama</span> noted for the attractive make-up of characters, elaborate costumes, detailed gestures and well-defined body movements presented in tune with the anchor playback music and complementary percussion. It originated in the country's present day state of <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">Kerala</span> during the 17th century and has developed over the years with improved looks, refined gestures and added themes besides more ornate singing and precise drumming.</span></span></p>
<h2 style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="mw-headline"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; font-weight: normal;">History</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; font-weight: normal;"></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Kottarakkarao complement Krishnanattam, which had its origin under the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Zamorins</span> of Kozhikode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Ignoring the first phase when it was <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Ramanattam</span>, Kathakali had its cradle in <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Vettattnad</span>. Here <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Vettathu Thampuran</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Kottayathu Thampuran</span> and many dedicated artists like <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Chathu Panicker</span> laid foundations for what is known as Kathakali now. Their efforts were concentrated on the rituals, classical details and scriptural perfection. Kottayathu Thampuran composed four great works -- Kirmeeravadham, Bakavadham, Nivathakavacha Kalakeyavadham and Kalyanasaugandhikam. After this the most important changes in Kathakali were brought about through the efforts of a single person namely, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Kaplingad Narayanan Nambudiri</span> (1739â€“1789). He was from the Northern <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Kerala</span>, but after basic instructions in various faculties of the art in <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Vettathu Kalari</span> he shifted to <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Travancore</span>. In the capital and many other centres he found many willing to co-operate with him in bringing about the reformations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Kathakali also shares a lot of similarities with Krishnanattam, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Koodiyattam</span> (a classical Sanskrit drama existing in Kerala) and <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Ashtapadiyattam</span> (an adaptation of 12th-century musical called <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Gitagovindam</span>). It also incorporates several other elements from traditional and ritualistic art forms like <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Mudiyettu</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Thiyyattu</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Theyyam</span> and <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Padayani</span> besides a minor share of folk arts like <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Porattunatakam</span>. All along, the martial art of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Kalarippayattu</span> has influenced the body language of Kathakali. The use of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Malayalam</span>, the local language (albeit as a mix of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Sanskrit</span> and Malayalam, called), has also helped the literature of Kathakali sound more transparent for the average audience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">As a part of modernising, propagating, promoting and popularizing Kathakali, the International Centre for Kathakali at New Delhi has taken up a continuing project since 1980 of producing new plays based on not only traditional and mythological stories, but also historical stories, European classics and Shakespeare's plays. Recently they produced Kathakali plays based on Shakespeare's Othello and Greek-Roman mythology of Psyche and Cupid.</span></p>
