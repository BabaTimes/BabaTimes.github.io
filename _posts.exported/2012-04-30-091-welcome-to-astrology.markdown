<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">Astrology consists of a number of <span class="mw-redirect">belief systems</span> which hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events in the human world. In the West, astrology most often consists of a system of horoscopes that claim to predict aspects of an individual's personality or life history based on the positions of the sun, moon, and other planetary objects at the time of their birth. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and the Indians, Chinese, and <span class="new">Mayans</span> developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations.</span></p>
