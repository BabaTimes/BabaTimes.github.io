<hr />
<h1 style="line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mount Kailash</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> (also </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mount Kailas</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">; </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Kangrinboqê</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> or Gang <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinpoche" title="Rinpoche"><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Rinpoche</span></a>, Gāngrénbōqí fēng) is a peak in the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Gangdisê Mountains</span>, which are part of the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Transhimalaya</span> in <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Tibet</span>. It lies near the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">source</span> of some of the longest <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">rivers</span> in Asia: the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Indus River</span>, the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Sutlej River</span> (a major tributary of the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Indus River</span>), the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Brahmaputra River</span>, and the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Karnali River</span> (a tributary of the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Ganges River</span>). It is considered a sacred place in five <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">religions</span>: <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Ayyavazhi</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Bön</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Buddhism</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Hinduism</span> and <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Jainism</span>. In Hinduism, it is considered to be the abode of Lord <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Shiva</span> and a place of eternal bliss. The mountain lies near <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Lake Manasarowar</span> and <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Lake Rakshastal</span> in Tibet.</span></span></h1>
<h2 style="line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"><span class="mw-headline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Religious significance</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"><span class="mw-headline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In Hinduism</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">According to <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Hinduism</span>, Lord <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Shiva</span>, the destroyer of ignorance and illusion, resides at the summit of a legendary mountain named Kailāsa, where he sits in a state of perpetual meditation along with his wife <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Pārvatī</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">According to Charles Allen, one description in the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Vishnu Purana</span> of the mountain states that its four faces are made of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">crystal</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">ruby</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">gold</span>, and <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">lapis lazuli</span>. It is a pillar of the world and is located at the heart of six mountain ranges symbolizing a lotus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">The ancient <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Koneswaram temple</span> of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Trincomalee</span> is heralded as "Dakshina Kailasam"/"Then Kailasam" (Kailash of the South) because it lies on exactly the same longitude as Mount Kailash and due to its pre-eminence in Saivite belief. Koneswaram's early black granite rock-cut architectural style shared similarities to famous <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Kailasanathar Temples</span> of the subcontinent, named after the mountain peak. Koneswaram's traditional history and legends were compiled into the Tamil corpus <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Tevaram</span> and the Sanskrit treatises Dakshina Kailasa Puranam — Sthala Puranam of Koneswaram, written in 1380 by <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan</span>, and the Dakshina Kailasa Manmiam — three chapters of the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Skanda Puranam</span> of unknown antiquity — manuscripts of which have been discovered and dated from the 5th — 7th century. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Many of the Kailasanathar temples sculptures and reliefs depict episodes relating to Lord Shiva and Maa Parvati, including Ravana's tale. (Ravana was a devotee of Lord Shiva. Ramayana does not document Ravana shaking the mountain.) Ravana's mother had fallen ill. As they were great Lord Shiva devotees, he had attempted to carry the temple on his back to bring it closer to his mother. Shiva, being stunned by his boldness, had blessed him with immortality as Ravana had passed Lord Shiva's test of devotion. </span></p>
