<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #808080;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';"><img style="margin-right: 8px; float: left;" src="images/perspectives/awakening/religion/pers-2.png" height="280" width="209" />This is the famous optical illusion image devised by the Danish psychologist <i>Edgar Rubin</i> often used to illustrate the concept of figure ground. When two fields have a common border, one is seen as <i>figure</i> and the other as <i>ground</i>. You can see the image as either a central vase, or two faces that are looking at each other. This image is popularly called the <b>Rubin's vase</b> (sometimes known as the <b>Rubin face</b> or the <b>figureâ€“ground vase</b>).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';"> </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #808080;"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';">The spiritual truth:</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';"> We see an article. The act of seeing has both an object (the particular article seen) as well as the subject (one who does the act of seeing). These two states (object and subject) are separate and distinct from one another. The body is seen, so it is the object. Atma (soul) sees, so it is the subject. This analogy can be extended to other acts such as perception or consciousness. The body is perceived, so it is the object. Atma (soul) does the act of perceiving . so it is the subject. Thus the body and the soul are separate from one another. He who considers the soul as that which is seen (that is, confuses the object for the subject) can only be termed as an aggyani (ignorant of reality/truth).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: #808080;">The spiritual seeker eventually acquires the intuitive wisdom of direct perception and understands the Eternal Truth and solves the mystery of how the Brahman (divine) is seen at the same time as both manifested in (immanent) and encompassing of the material world (transcendent). He realizes his oneness with God and understands that he himself is a microcosm of immanence and transcendence (Non-duality).</span></p>
