<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">The concept of chakra features in <span style="color: #000000;">tantric</span> and <span style="color: #000000;">yogic</span> traditions of <span style="color: #000000;">Hinduism</span> and <span style="color: #000000;">Buddhism</span>. Its name derives from the <span style="color: #000000;">Sanskrit</span> word for "<span style="color: #000000;">wheel</span>" or "<span style="color: #000000;">turning</span>", pronounced in Hindi; Pali.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">While breath channels (<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: windowtext;">nā</span><span style="color: windowtext;">ḍ</span><span style="color: windowtext;">is</span></span>) of yogic practices had already been discussed in the classical <span style="color: #000000;">Upanishads</span>, it was not until Tantric works, such as the eighth-century Buddhist <span style="color: #000000;">Hevajra Tantra</span> and Caryāgiti, that hierarchies of chakras were introduced. According to traditional Indian medicine, the chakras are a number of wheel-like <span style="color: #000000;">vortices</span> which exist in the surface of the <span style="color: #000000;">subtle body</span> of living beings. The chakras are said to be "force centers" or whorls of <span style="color: #000000;">energy</span> permeating, from a point on the physical body, the layers of the <span style="color: #000000;">subtle bodies</span> in an ever-increasing fan-shaped formation. Rotating vortices of subtle <span style="color: #000000;">matter</span>, they are considered focal points for the reception and transmission of energies. Different belief systems posit a varying number of chakras; the best-known system in the West has seven chakras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">It is typical for chakras to be depicted as either flower-like or wheel-like. In the former case, "petals" are shown around the perimeter of a circle. In the latter, spokes divide the circle into segments making the chakra resemble a wheel (or "chakra"). Each chakra possesses a specific number of segments or petals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Texts describing the chakras go back as far as the later <span style="color: #000000;">Upanishads</span>, for example the Yoga Kundalini Upanishad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Although there are various interpretations as to what exactly a chakra is, the following features are common to all systems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">They form part of a subtle energy body, along with the energy channels, or <span style="color: #000000;">nadis</span>, and the subtle winds, or <span style="color: #000000;">pranas</span></span></li>
<li style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">They are located along a central nadi, <span style="color: #000000;">Sushumna</span> which runs either alongside or inside the spine.</span></li>
<li style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Two other nadis, <span style="color: #000000;">Ida</span> and <span style="color: #000000;">Pingala</span> also run through the chakras, and alongside Sushumna. They occasionally cross Sushumna at the location of the chakras.</span></li>
<li style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">They possess a number of 'petals' or 'spokes'. In some traditions, such as the Tibetan, these spokes branch off into the thousands of nadis that run throughout the human body.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">They are generally associated with a <span style="color: #000000;">mantra</span> seed-syllable, and often</span> </span></p>
