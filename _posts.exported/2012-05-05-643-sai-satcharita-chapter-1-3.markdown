<p><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">Around the year 1910, Shirdi was plagued by the epidemic of Cholera. The people of Shirdi asked Baba for help, claiming that they did not know what to do to help their loved ones. After hearing many such requests, Baba awoke one morning, washed his hands and face, and started to grind wheat using a hand mill. The villagers were confused as to how this practice would help their sick families, but still helped Baba with His task. Finally, when all the wheat was ground into flour, Baba told the villagers to take scatter the flour around the village borders. When the villagers asked why, Baba smiled knowingly and told them that the Cholera would subside. Baba’s devotees believed that it was not wheat, but the disease, that had been ground and thrown away from the village. Shirdi was no longer plagued by Cholera within a few months, and the villagers lived well.</span></span></p>
