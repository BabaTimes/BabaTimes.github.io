<h1 style="line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: #000000;">Mahabalipuram</span></strong></h1>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Mahabalipuram, derived from 'Mamallapuram' is the prior and colloquial name of a town in <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Kancheepuram district</span> in the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Indian</span> <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">state</span> of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Tamil Nadu</span>, now officially called Mamallapuram. It has an average elevation of 12&nbsp;metres (39&nbsp;feet).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Mahabalipuram was a 7th century port city of the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">South Indian</span> dynasty of the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Pallavas</span> around 60&nbsp;km south from the city of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Chennai</span> in Tamil Nadu. The name Mamallapuram is believed to have been given after the Pallava king <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Narasimhavarman I</span>, who took on the epithet Maha-malla (great wrestler), as the favourite sport of the Pallavas was wrestling. It has various historic monuments built largely between the 7th and the 9th centuries, and has been classified as a UNESCO <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">World Heritage Site</span>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Megalithic</span> burial urns, cairn circles and jars with burials dating to the very dawn of the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Christian era</span> have been discovered near Mamallapuram. The Sangam age poem <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">Perumpā</span><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">ṇ</span><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">ā</span><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">ṟṟ</span><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">uppa</span><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">ṭ</span><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">ai</span></span> relates the rule of King Thondaiman Ilam Thiraiyar at <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Kanchipuram</span> of the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Tondai Nadu</span> port Nirppeyyaru which scholars identify with the present-day Mamallapuram. Chinese coins and Roman coins of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Theodosius I</span> in the 4th century CE have been found at Mamallapuram revealing the port as an active hub of global trade in the late classical period. Two Pallava coins bearing legends read as Srihari and Srinidhi have been found at Mamallapuram. The Pallava kings ruled Mamallapuram from Kanchipuram; the capital of the Pallava dynasty from the 3rd century to 9th century CE, and used the port to launch diplomatic missions to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceylon" title="Ceylon"><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Ceylon</span></a> and Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">An 8th century Tamil text written by <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Thirumangai Alvar</span> described this place as Kadal Mallai, (Sea Mountain) ‘where the ships rode at anchor bent to the point of breaking laden as they were with wealth, big trunked elephants and gems of nine varieties in heaps’. It is also known by several other names such as Mamallapattana and Mamallapuram. Another name by which Mahabalipuram has been known to mariners, at least since <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Marco Polo</span>’s time is "Seven Pagodas" alluding to the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Seven Pagodas of Mahabalipuram</span> that stood on the shore, of which one, the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Shore Temple</span>, survives. The temples of Mamallapuram, portraying events described in the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Mahabharata</span>, built largely during the reigns of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Narasimhavarman</span> and his successor Rajasimhavarman, showcase the movement from rock-cut architecture to structural building. The city of Mahabalipuram was largely developed by the Pallava king <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Narasimhavarman I</span> in the 7th century AD. The <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">mandapa</span> or pavilions and the rathas or shrines shaped as temple <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">chariots</span> are hewn from the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">granite</span> rock face, while the famed Shore Temple, erected half a century later, is built from dressed stone. What makes Mamallapuram so culturally resonant are the influences it absorbs and disseminates. The Shore Temple includes many bas reliefs, including one 100&nbsp;ft. long and 45&nbsp;ft. high, carved out of granite. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">All but one of the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">rathas</span> from the first phase of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Pallava</span> architecture are modeled on the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Buddhist</span> viharas or <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">monasteries</span> and <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">chaitya</span> halls with several cells arranged around a courtyard. Art historian <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Percy Brown</span>, in fact, traces the possible roots of the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Pallava</span> <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Mandapa</span> to the similar rock-cut caves of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Ajanta Caves</span> and <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Ellora Caves</span>. Referring to Narasimhavarman's victory in AD 642 over the Chalukyan king <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Pulakesin II</span>, Brown says the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Pallava</span> king may have brought the sculptors and artisans back to <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Kanchi</span> and <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Mamallapuram</span> as 'spoils of war'. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">The fact that different shrines were dedicated to different deities is evidence of an increased sectarianism at the time of their construction. A bas-relief on a sculpted cliff has an image of Shiva and a shrine dedicated to Vishnu, indicating the growing importance of these <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Sangam period</span> deities and a weakening of the roles of Vedic gods such as Indra and Soma </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">The modern city of Mahabalipuram was established by the British in 1827.</span> </span></p>
