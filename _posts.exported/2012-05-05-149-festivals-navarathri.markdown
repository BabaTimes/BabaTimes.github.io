<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Navratri is a festival dedicated to the worship of a Hindu deity <span style="text-decoration: none;">Shakti</span>. The word Navaratri literally means nine nights in Sanskrit, nava meaning nine and ratri meaning nights. During these nine nights and ten days, nine forms of <span style="text-decoration: none;">Shakti</span>/<span style="text-decoration: none;">Devi</span> are worshiped. The 10th day is commonly referred to as <span style="text-decoration: none;">Vijayadashami</span> or Dussehra.</span></p>
