<hr />
<div style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">Although many devotees came to visit Shirdi to obtain Sai Baba’s blessings, people believed that they could not enter or leave the village of God until He gave them permission. Sometimes, He would give hints or suggestions, and other times, His hints would be less overt. Devotees who followed Baba’s word were rewarded, while those who did not usually fell into problems.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">Once, Baba’s devotee, Tatya Kote, came to Baba in a rush and told Him that he was going to Kopargtaon Bazaar. Baba told him not to rush, and to wait a while before leaving. Not listening to His words, Tatya Kote immediately left the village on his bullock cart. Soon, one of the horses steering the cart sprained its leg, and fell down. Tatya returned to the village and acknowledged his mistake in not listening to Baba’s advice.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">Another instance of this was seen when a wealthy European man arrived in Shirdi to obtain Baba’s blessings. He wanted to be treated differently than the other devotees, and wanted special permission to kneel before Baba and kiss His hand. Baba did not like this, and prevented his entry into the mosque on every attempt. Baba told the man to sit with the other devotees, to which the man got angry and threatened to leave Shirdi. Baba told the man to stay another night in Shirdi, and that He would meet him the next day. The European man left the village anyway, meeting with an accident on the way. After seeing the problems that fell upon people who didn’t listen to Baba’s words, everyone that entered the village was careful to ask for Baba’s permission and blessings before journeying into and out of Shirdi.</span></div>
