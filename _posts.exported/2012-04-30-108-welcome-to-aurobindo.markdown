<p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Sri Aurobindo speaks of two movements: that of involution of consciousness from an omnipresent Reality to creation, and an evolution from creation onward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;">The process by which the Energy of creation emerged from a timeless, spaceless, ineffable, immutable Reality, Sri Aurobindo refers to as the Involution. In that process the Reality extended itself to Being/Existence (Sat), Consciousness (that generated a Force) - Chit; and Delight (Ananda)-- self enjoyment in existing and being conscious. Through the action of a fourth dimension, Supermind (i.e. Truth Consciousness), the Force (Chit) of Sat-Chit-Ananda was divided into Knowledge and Will, eventually formulating as an invisible Energy that would become the source of creation. Through its own willful self-absorption of consciousness, the universe would begin as Inconscient material existence.</span></p>
