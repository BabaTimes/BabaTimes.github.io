<h1 style="line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;">Indian art</span></strong></h1>
<hr />
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Indian Art is the <span style="text-decoration: none;">visual art</span> produced on the Indian subcontinent from about the 3rd millennium BC to modern times. To viewers schooled in the Western tradition, Indian art may seem overly ornate and sensuous; appreciation of its refinement comes only gradually, as a rule. Voluptuous feeling is given unusually free expression in Indian culture. A strong sense of design is also characteristic of Indian art and can be observed in its modern as well as in its traditional forms.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;">The vast scope of the art of India intertwines with the cultural history, religions and philosophies which place art production and patronage in social and cultural contexts.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Indian art can be classified into specific periods each reflecting particular religious, political and cultural developments.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Ancient period</span> (3900 <span style="text-decoration: none;">BCE</span>-1200 <span style="text-decoration: none;">CE</span>)</span></li>
<li style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Islamic ascendancy</span> (1192-1757)</span></li>
<li style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Colonial period</span> (1757â€“1947)</span></li>
<li style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Independence</span> and the <span style="text-decoration: none;">postcolonial</span> period (Post-1947)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"><span class="mw-headline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Jewelry</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;">The <span style="text-decoration: none;">Indian subcontinent</span> has the longest continuous legacy of jewellery-making, with a history of over 5,000 years. One of the first to start jewellery-making were the peoples of the <span style="text-decoration: none;">Indus Valley Civilization</span>. Early jewellery making in <span style="text-decoration: none;">China</span> started around the same period, but it became widespread with the spread of <span style="text-decoration: none;">Buddhism</span> around 2,000 years ago.</span></p>
<h2 style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"><span class="mw-headline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Temple and Sculpture-art</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Indian rock art has continuously evolved, since the first rock cut caves, to suit different purposes, social and religious contexts, and regional differences. Obscurity shrouds the period between the decline of the <span style="text-decoration: none;">Harappans</span> and the definite historic period starting with the <span style="text-decoration: none;">Mauryas</span>, and in the historical period, the earliest Indian religion to inspire major artistic monuments was <span style="text-decoration: none;">Buddhism</span>. Though there may have been earlier structures in wood that have been transformed into stone structures, there are no physical evidences for these except textual references. Soon after the Buddhists initiated the rock-cut caves, <span style="text-decoration: none;">Hindus</span> and <span style="text-decoration: none;">Jains</span> started to imitate them at <span style="text-decoration: none;">Badami</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">Aihole</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">Ellora</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">Salsette</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">Elephanta</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">Aurangabad</span> and <span style="text-decoration: none;">Mamallapuram</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Buddhist art first developed during the <span style="text-decoration: none;">Gandhara</span> period and <span style="text-decoration: none;">Amaravati</span> Periods around the first century BCE. It flourished greatly during the <span style="text-decoration: none;">Gupta</span> Periods and <span style="text-decoration: none;">Pala</span> Periods that comprise the Golden Age of India. Although the most glorious art of these Indian empires was mostly Buddhist in nature, subsequently Hindu Empires like the <span style="text-decoration: none;">Pallava</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">Chola</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">Hoysala</span> and <span style="text-decoration: none;">Vijayanagara</span> Empires developed their own styles of Hindu art as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt;">There is no time line that divides the creation of rock-cut temples and free-standing temples built with cut stone as they developed in parallel. The building of free-standing structures began in 5th century, while rock cut temples continued to be excavated until the 12th century. An example of a free-standing structural temple is the <span style="text-decoration: none;">Shore Temple</span>, a part of the <span style="text-decoration: none;">Mahabalipuram</span> World Heritage Site, with its slender tower, built on the shore of the <span style="text-decoration: none;">Bay of Bengal</span> with finely carved <span style="text-decoration: none;">granite</span> rocks cut like bricks and dating from the 8th century. </span></p>
