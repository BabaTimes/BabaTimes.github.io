<h1 style="line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;">Indian Music</span></strong></h1>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">The music of India includes multiple varieties of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">folk</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">popular</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">pop</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">classical music</span> and <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">R&amp;B</span>. <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">India</span>'s classical <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">music</span> tradition, including <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Carnatic</span> and <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Hindustani music</span>, has a history spanning millennia and developed over several eras. It remains fundamental to the lives of Indians today as sources of spiritual inspiration, cultural expression and pure entertainment. India is made up of several dozen <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">ethnic groups</span>, speaking their own <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">languages</span> and <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">dialects</span>, having distinct cultural traditions.</span></p>
<h2 style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"><span class="mw-headline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Classical music</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></span></h2>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Main article: <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Indian classical music</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">The two main traditions of classical music are Carnatic music, found predominantly in the peninsular regions, and Hindustani music, found in the northern and central regions.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: verdana,geneva; color: #000000;">Further information: <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Indian classical music</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Hindustani music</span>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Carnatic music</span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"><span class="mw-headline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Hindustani music</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Hindustani music is an Indian classical music tradition that goes back to <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Vedic times</span> around 1000 BC. It further developed circa the 13th and 14th centuries AD with Persian influences and from existing religious and folk music. The practice of singing based on notes was popular even from the Vedic times where the hymns in Sama Veda, a sacred text, were sung as Samagana and not chanted. Developing a strong and diverse tradition over several centuries, it has contemporary traditions established primarily in India but also in Pakistan and Bangladesh. In contrast to Carnatic music, the other main Indian classical music tradition originating from the South, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, historical <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Vedic philosophy</span> and native Indian sounds but also enriched by the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Persian</span> performance practices of the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Mughals</span>. Classical genres are <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">dhrupad</span>, dhamar, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">khyal</span>, tarana and sadra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">The present form of Carnatic music is based on historical developments that can be traced to the 15th - 16th centuries AD and thereafter. However, the form itself is reputed to have been one of the gifts bestowed on man by the gods of Hindu mythology. It is one of the oldest musical forms that continue to survive today.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"><span class="mw-headline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Carnatic music</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Carnatic music is <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">melodic</span>, with improvised variations. It consists of a composition with improvised embellishments added to the piece in the forms of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Raga Alapana</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Kalpanaswaram</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Neraval</span>, and, in the case of more advanced students, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Ragam Tanam Pallavi</span>. The main emphasis is on the vocals as most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in a singing style (known as gāyaki). There are about 7.2 million ragas (or scales) in Carnatic Music, with around 300 still in use today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Purandara Dasa</span> is considered the father of carnatic music. Sri <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Tyagaraja</span>, Sri <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Shyama Shastry</span> and Sri <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Muthuswami Dikshitar</span> are considered the trinity of carnatic music and with them came the golden age in carnatic music in the 18th-19th century</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Noted artists of Carnatic Music include <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">MS Subbulakshmi</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar</span> (the father of the current concert format), <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer</span>, Prapancham Sita Raman, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">TN Seshagopalan</span> and more recently <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Sanjay Subrahmanyan</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Balamuralikrishna</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">K J Yesudas</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">N.Ramani</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Lalgudi Jayaraman</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">umayalapuram sivaraman</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Dr.Mysore Manjunath</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Mysore Nagaraj</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">TM Krishna</span>, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Bombay Jayashri</span>, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Every December, the city of Chennai in India has its six week-long <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Music Season</span>, which has been described as the world's largest cultural event. It has served as the foundation for most music in South India, including folk music, festival music and has also extended its influence to film music in the past 100–150 years or so.</span></p>
