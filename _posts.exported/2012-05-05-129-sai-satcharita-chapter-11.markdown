<hr />
<div style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #808080;">Dr Pandit was a friend of Tatyasaheb Noolkar and also a devotee of Sri Shirdi Sai Baba. He came to Baba’s Mosque, and after darshan, decided to stay with Him and His devotees in Shirdi. One day, Dr Pandit reached for Baba’s puja plate, and applied sandalwood paste on Babas forehead. To everyone’s surprise,&nbsp; Baba did not say anything, and allowed Dr Pandit to do so. Baba later told the other devotees that He allowed Dr Pandit to put sandal paste on His head because Dr Pandit’s heart was pure. It was an act of devoutness to his Guru, so Baba was happy about it.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; color: #808080;">The story of Sidik Falke is one that shows Babas grace and will. Sidik Falke was a Muslim man who had made pilgrimages to Mecca, Medina, and Shirdi. He lived in Shirdi, and sat facing Baba’s mosque every day. Baba did not allow him inside the mosque for nine months, for which Falke felt very bad. Falke asked other devotees to help him enter Baba’s heart. Shama, one of Baba’s most beloved devotees, tried to help Falke by acting as a go-between for Falke and Baba. Baba asked Falke difficult questions, for which Falke always assented. Finally, Baba went to Falke with anger and told him that he did not need Baba’s blessing as he already prayed to Allah. Falke lowered his head and gave himself to Baba freely, for which Baba was then happy and accepted him as his devotee. Baba saw that Falke was not religiously swayed or biased. He was happy to pray to all Gods and treat all religion as one. </span><br /></span></div>
