<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">Most of us have first-hand experience that lots of sugar, carbs and, junk food make us feel very irritated. Earlier this month, Dr. Robert Lustig told CBS News’ <span>“60 minutes”</span> that sugar is addictive, toxic, and it’s killing us by increasing our risk of heart disease, type II diabetes, hypertension and cancer. The pediatric endocrinologist has even gone as far as to say that sugar should be regulated like cigarettes and alcohol.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';"></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">History shows that in 6000 B.C. usage of sugarcane in papau New guinea is recorded. And in 1000 B.C. India started making sugar crystals called GUR with sugarcane, by crushing the cane and boiling the juice. When Alexander the Great invaded India In 325 B.C. came across this miracle reed (sugar cane) from which sugar was made without honeybees. Beet sugar was made from beet roots only by the 19th century. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';"></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">There are two kinds of sugar: <span>naturally</span> <span>occurring</span> and <span>added sugars</span>. &nbsp;Mother Nature provides us with many naturally-occurring sugars in our foods. For example, yogurt, milk, and fruit – all healthy foods- contain sugar. Lactose is the sugar in milk and yogurt; fructose is the sugar in fruit.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';"></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">Added sugars are sweeteners that are added to food and beverages during the manufacturing process. Common sweeteners added to foods include fructose and high fructose corn syrup. Desserts, sugar-sweetened beverages like sodas, energy and sports drinks, are the top sources of added sugar in most American diets.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';"></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">For example, a 12-ounce can of regular soda contains about 25-35 grams of high fructose corn syrup but provides our bodies with no other nutrients. In comparison, one cup of blueberries contains about seven grams of natural fructose and also packs a powerful punch of fiber, antioxidants and important vitamins and minerals.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';"></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">The American Heart Association recommends that most women have no more than 100 calories per day from added sugar, which equals about 6 teaspoons (25 grams). For men, no more than 150 calories from added sugars or about 9 teaspoons (38 grams). That’s much less than you may think: 1 small candy bar, ½ cup of ice cream or frozen yogurt is equal to about 100-150 calories.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';"></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.25in; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the label for sugar. Look out for these names in the label when you go food shopping this week –Sugar, Brown sugar, High fructose corn syrup,Corn sugar, Syrup, Corn syrup, Fructose, Glucose, Sucrose, Raw sugar, Turbinado sugar, Honey. If most of these are in the top, avoid or replace them with natural foods like fruits and vegetables.</span></p>
