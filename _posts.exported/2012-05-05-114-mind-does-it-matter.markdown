He was cloning Human Muscle Tissues forty years back at University of Wisconsin. Baba Times attempts to extract the excerpts from his speeches and presents here. The complete credit for this content is given to Dr.Bruce Lipton</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: #808080;">Bruce Lipton used to clone Human Muscle Cells forty years back at the University of Wisconsin. His speech on the topic ‘Piecing It All Together’ is an amazing eye-opener on how he correlates ‘beliefs’ and ‘biology’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: #808080;">What controls Biology? It is a conventional thinking that ‘genes’ control the biology which was found to be wrong in the light of New Age findings about how our belief systems controls our body and behavior. He also goes on to show the molecular connection between the beliefs and the control of genes. Knowledge is Power. It is also true that ‘Lack of Knowledge’ is ‘Lack of Power’. If genes were already established at the time of birth then we are all victims of hereditary and that leads to an irresponsible behavior and accepting what we are and fading deeper into our own down fall. Power of Knowledge enables us to control our lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: #808080;">&nbsp;Until 1950, the Newtonian Universal Concept was ruling the scientific world for hundreds of years. Newtonian Mechanics tells us that the universe is made of matter and it is like a clock work, everything is predictable if the behavior of the individual matter is predictable. The present Pharmacology conveniently supports this idea, as human body is made of parts and they can be replaced or repaired and the parts control the human body and behavior. It all changed when Albert Einstein explained that the universe is made of energy (invisible) and not matter. Only energy manifests matter. This means that energy can cure and alter behaviors and this is hard for business community to accept as it might take away all the prospects of selling drugs! To understand the connection, we must understand the Cell structure. There are about 50 to 75 trillion cells in a human body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: #808080;">The Nucleus is the central core of the cell which is similar to human brain controlling the whole body. The Cell in a way is very similar to human body as it has the same functions as the human body like digestive system, respiratory system and reproductive system etc. It was thought that the genes in the Nucleus control the biology and behavior. In an experiment it revealed that even after isolating the Nucleus the cell survived for months going about its normal functions unlike when human brain when removed will kill the body. So it was conclusive that the Nucleus (and the genes in it) is not controlling the cells.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: #808080;">The cells are machines made up of proteins which are parts. There are 70,000 type of proteins found. They make the structure of the cell and the body in turn. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: #808080;">Proteins are nothing but strings made up of amino acids like beads. The variety of proteins comes from the length of the string and the sequence of the amino acid molecules. The ends of the protein chain are negatively charged. As it is protein do not do anything and there is no life. When a positive signal comes in contact with one of the ends of the protein, it makes it positive charge due its strength. Now the two end of the protein clamps together as opposite charge attracts from its previous position of a chain where the same charge repelled from each other. So the outside signal created the protein movement and created life. Life is nothing but movement in space by itself. Proteins make structure while signals make life. The signals can be electromagnetic, estrogens or hormones etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: #808080;">The process of signal from outside (environment signal) is as follows. Like the human body, there are sensors on the skin of the cell (as we have eyes, ears and nose on our skin of the body). The Cell skin consists of two layers and there is protection oil between them. There are receptors (proteins) and Effectors (proteins), when the receptor detects a signal it allows the Effectors to pass those signals inside. These signals in turn clamp to the proteins inside to do various functions. If it is a digestive signal then the proteins open and close to rip the food nutrients apart, if it is calcium signal then the proteins move the muscles etc. Behavior is made of movements and movements come from signals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: #808080;">There is a problem, proteins like mechanical parts they wear out and have to be reproduced into strings. In the Nucleus we have the double helix structure of DNA which is covered by protection protein layer which has ‘regulatory proteins’ at periodical intervals. These signals activate the ‘regulatory proteins’ and opens up the protein sleeve. Then the RNA copies the DNA code of the protein and this is used by the signal for the function. So the DNA is just a master blue print of all the proteins and does not do anything by itself. A good example is, if the arm is the DNA and it is written ‘blue eyes’. But the protein covers it as a sleeve and we can not read it until the protein is removed. The cover protein is removed by an outside signal. If it as a ‘cancer’ written DNA, un-covering the protein sleeve will make more ‘cancer’ DNA! About 50% of the Cells is DNA and 50% is Protein. We were focusing on the DNA (genes) for 50 years and threw away the protein control aspect. So it can be concluded that if the protein sleeve is not removed then we don’t read the bad DNA and reproduce them!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: #808080;">When a signal comes in and if there is no matching proteins, then by ‘random mutations’ genes change to match the environment. But it was believed that the outcome is random and cannot be predicted. But we now understand that it is not random but adaptive as published by John Cairns in 1988. Genes change and adapt themselves according to the environment signals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: #808080;">The cells have only two main programs, either growth (or reproduction) or protection. It moves towards nutrients (growth) or away from toxins (protection). But these programs are activated only by external signals as we saw above through the action and movement of the proteins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: #808080;">Let us see how the external environment signal gets converted into a control signal on the cell itself. The signal is perceived as a perception by the brain and then trickles down to the cells. When we are under stress, the Hypothalamus in the brain activates the Pituitary glands to squeeze the blood to the arm muscles taking away from ‘growth’ functions for protection. So under stress the cells stop growth, which leads to ill health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: #808080;">Until we are about six years old, we program our sub conscious mind with our experiences and perception from the environment which later forms guide book for the personality what we become. We create filters between the environment and our brain which in turn creates perception based on what we are and not based on actual environment. There are simple tools with which we can remove this filter. Baba Times will cover this in detail in the next issue.</span></p>
