<h2 style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-weight: normal;">The Samskāra are a series of sacraments, sacrifices and rituals that serve as <span class="mw-redirect">rites of passage</span> and mark the various stages of the human life and to signify entry to a particular <span class="mw-redirect">Ashrama</span>. All human beings, especially the Dvija or twice-born are required to perform a number of sacrifices with oblations for gods, Ancestors and Guardians in accordance with the Vedic dictums for a <span class="mw-redirect">Dharmic</span> or righteous life. Basically all these rituals are of the nature of purification, and they remove sins (pāpa) and/or bestow good qualities (gunas).</span></h2>
