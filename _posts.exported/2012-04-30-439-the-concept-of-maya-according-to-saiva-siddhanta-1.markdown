<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">Maya helps a great deal in the liberation of the <em>jiva</em> from transmigration. <em>Anava</em>, <em>karma</em> and <em>maya</em> are said to be the <em>malas</em> of the <em>jiva</em>. Of these, <em>anava</em> (darkness) is the cause of repeated births of the soul by fostering ignorance. But <em>maya</em> helps the soul to get freed from ignorance and thus be liberated from births. That which propels the <em>jiva</em> through the inducement of darkness, having maya for its (<em>jiva’s</em>) prop, is karma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">How maya helps the jiva is described by Siddhantic scriptures thus:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">“Maya, according to the karmas of the souls, becomes the body, etc. of the souls. Till the souls obtain the necessary knowledge to attain the Grace of God, maya helps the souls like a lamp (which gives light to people till the dawn of the sun).”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">When the Lord’s grace is attained, the darkness of <em>anava</em> will totally vanish. Till then, the lamp of maya helps the souls not to suffer in the darkness of <em>anava</em>. This is the meaning of the text.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">Since maya thus helps the <em>jivas</em>, maya is called ‘a good relation’. To regard such a maya as the cause of births would not be right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">“When will the three <em>eshanas</em> inseparable from <em>maya</em> cease?” says Arunagiri. By this he means, the three <em>eshanas</em> which cause attachment to the perishable universe of maya regarding it (maya) as permanent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">Thus, though maya helps the <em>jivas</em>. But knowing its unreal nature, it has to be abandoned; only then can liberation be attained. That which does not allow it to be abandoned is ignorance; and this ignorance is caused by <em>anava</em> (darkness) and not maya. Wherever and whenever there is ignorance, it is to be understood as an effect of <em>anava</em>. Therefore, maya is faultless; the <em>anava</em> that holds to it is at fault.</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="bodyTahoma"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">The soul has, of necessity, to pass through the 84 <em>lakh yonis</em>, and only after obtaining a human birth it can attain God.</span></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">A soul takes a body only on account of karmas. Whatever be the body, on the exhaustion of karmas, the soul will attain liberation. Therefore, the number of births is dependent on the <em>karmas</em> of the soul. Souls that have less karmas can attain liberation even in one or two births. But if the karmas are not exhausted even after taking births in 84 <em>lakh yonis</em>, the souls take births again and again in those same <em>yonis</em>. Therefore, to say that souls have to pass through the 84 <em>lakh yonis</em> to attain liberation is not correct.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li class="bodyTahoma"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">Rare is a human birth, because only through it the soul can attain God.</span></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">It is not necessary that the knowledge necessary to attain God can arise in the soul only on obtaining a human birth. It can arise in births like an ant, etc. There are a number of instances where souls in the bodies of an ant, elephant, snake, etc. have attained such knowledge. Did these attain salvation through the human body, which you call “the doorway to salvation”?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li class="bodyTahoma"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">Souls have to take births in the ascending order of plants, animals, humans and Devas.</span></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">A student in Class 3 can be promoted to Class 5 through Class 4, as also directly. He can also be demoted, all dependent upon his intelligence. Similarly, the soul that is born as a plant can obtain a Deva’s birth, and a Deva may be born as a dog or fox. All depends upon the good-bad deeds.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li class="bodyTahoma"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">The law of karma comes into operation only at the human level.</span></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">Without a body, the soul cannot exist. And there can be no body without karmas. That a soul gets a body that will correspond to its karmas. Therefore, there is no body (for the soul) without karmas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">It may be asked: If so, the soul from its subtle condition, when it takes its first body, on what does its body depend (as it is held by some that there being no body for the soul in its subtle condition, it has no karmas, too)? The answer is: That also is depending in its Karmas! When the soul is in its subtle condition, the <em>anava</em> (darkenss) griping it will induce desire in it. That desire becomes karma and, as a result, the soul obtains a body in its first birth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">Therefore, to say that karmas obtain only in the human level and not in the lower <em>yonis</em> does not stand to reason.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li class="bodyTahoma"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">There is freedom for the soul (to do virtuous or otherwise deeds) only in the human birth.</span></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino;">The souls have no freedom in any birth. The only person who has freedom is God. (This is one of the fundamental truths of Saiva Siddhanta). The peculiar characteristic of the soul is that it partakes of the nature of that to which it gets united. Accordingly, when the soul tries to unite itself with the Pati, it gets a little enlightenment and performs good deeds; when it joins Pasas, it will perform evil deeds. To so join (the Pati or Pasam) is also due to its past karmas<em>.</em> Therefore, the soul has no freedom.</span></p>
