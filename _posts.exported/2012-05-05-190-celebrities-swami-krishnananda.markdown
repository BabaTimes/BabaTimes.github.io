He was a disciple of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Swami Sivananda</span> and served as the General Secretary of the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Divine Life Society</span> in <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Rishikesh</span>, India from 1958 until 2001.

<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Swami Krishnananda was President of the Sivananda Literature Research Institute and the Sivananda Literature Dissemination Committee.

<h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"><strong><span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">The eldest of six children, Swami Krishnananda was born on April 25, 1922, into a highly religious and an orthodox <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhva" title="Madhva"><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Madhva</span></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin" title="Brahmin"><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Brahmin</span></a> family. He was named Subbaraya by his parents. He was educated at the high school in <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Puttur, Karnataka</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">By the study of Sanskrit works like the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Gita</span>, the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Upanishads</span>, and the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Vedas</span>, Swami Krishnananda became rooted in <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Advaita Vedanta</span> philosophy, though he belonged to the traditional Madhva-sect (<span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Dvaita</span> Vedanta), which follows the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">dualistic</span> philosophy. In 1943, Subbaraya took up Government service at Hospet in the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Bellary</span> District, but it did not last long. Before the end of the same year, he left for Sivananda's <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">ashram</span>, the Divine Life Society (DLS). Sivananda initiated the young man into the holy order of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Sannyasa</span> (Hindu <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">monasticism</span>) on the Indian sacred day of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Makar Sankranti</span>, January 14, 1946, and he was named Swami Krishnananda.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"><strong><span class="mw-headline">Ashram life</span></strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Krishnananda was initially engaged at the DLS in letter writing, writing messages and assistance in compiling and editing books. Later, he typed manuscripts produced by Sivananda, including the two hand-written volumes of the <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Brahma Sutras</span>. In 1948, Sivananda asked him to write books on philosophy and religion; from then onwards he also conducted classes and lectures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Krishnananda later worked with a committee that was established to improve the management of the DLS and at this time he became a Secretary, concerned especially with the management of finance. He continued this work until 1961, when, due to the extended absence of <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Swami Chidananda</span>, then President of the DLS, Sivananda nominated him as General Secretary. He held that position until his death, at which time he was the longest serving General Secretary of the institution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Sivananda appointed Krishnananda as President of the Sivananda Literature Research Institute when it was formed in 1958. Krishnananda was also appointed as the President of the Sivananda Literature Dissemination Committee, which was formed to bring out translations of Sivananda's works in the major Indian languages. In 1961, Krishnananda became editor of the DLS's monthly publication, Divine Life. He held the position for 20 years.</span></p>
