<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';">A Mandir, Devalayam, Devasthanam, or a Hindu temple is a place of worship for followers of Hinduism. A characteristic of most temples is the presence of murtis (statues) of the <span class="mw-redirect">Hindu deity</span> to whom the temple is dedicated. They are usually dedicated to one primary deity, the presiding deity, and other deities associated with the main deity. However, some temples are dedicated to several deities, and others are dedicated to murtis in an aniconic form. Many temples are in key geographical points, such as a hill top, near <span class="mw-redirect">waterfalls</span>, caves and rivers, because some believe the Puranas mention that "the gods always play where groves are near rivers, mountains, and springs."</span></p>
